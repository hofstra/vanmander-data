<ab>or the door which opens to many Arts: 
goldsmithing, building, and more. Indeed,
the seven liberal Arts could not live without her;
for the art of drawing, which embraces all things, 
holds all the Arts in her measured bonds.<sup>2</sup></ab>

<ab>2. She is a generous Nurse of all the arts, 
as Natalis Comes tells us.<sup>3</sup>
Yes, likewise noble and instructive Grammar,  
was raised by her and swiftly grew, 
learning from her to recognize letters and symbols
so that People of different languages 
harmoniously grasp one another’s intentions, 
whether they are near or far.</ab>

<ab>3. The Perfection of the art of Drawing must derive
from a solid intelligence, and the intelligence
must be built up through practice
and sustained by a natural spirit, 
which is nobly skilled at enrichment,
and by quick attentiveness. 
Thus with good judgment the Artist creates in his mind
a design of everything he is pleased to sketch by hand.<sup>4</sup></ab>

<ab>4. This Father of Painting is a remarkable	
expression for uncovering and Clarifying
hidden ideas–indeed, the witness
to the intention, which consists
steadily in tracing, sketching and defining,
to capture everything in the World
in the range of our vision, especially
the Human figure, most magnificent creation.</ab>

<ab>5. Now Youngsters, to pursue this goal, that is,
to become competent in the art of Drawing, 
you must begin, with great dedication,
at the oval, and drawing the cross within it;  
to learn to draw a face deftly
from all sides, very important: it is disgraceful
that one sees many painters misalign the face,
laboring in vain because they ignore the cross.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Very important to understand the oval and the cross.  </ab>

<ab>6. Further, there is no shame in learning from other works
to place a figure in the proper stable position, without faltering,
on one foot, where the weight of the body rests,
as described in the chapter on Pose:
let the hip swing over the standing foot.<sup>5</sup>
Now we would be very grateful to a great Master
If he had published on your behalf, O youths,
an illustrated ABC book introducing our Art.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>There ought to be a Book as an introduction for young Painters, for learning to place a Figure with ease, and thus leading to greater perfection. </ab>
