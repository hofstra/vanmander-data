<ab>4. Be warned, then, for the throat of Art  <lb/>
sweetly mimics the voices of the Sirens  <lb/>
and pleasantly lures each one to the performance;  <lb/>
but in order to reach her one must attempt  <lb/>
many paths and swim through waters;  <lb/>
then there is a mountain to climb, <lb/>
so high that you do not reach the top, early or late, <lb/> 
unless you have the benefit of nature. <lb/>

<ab>5.  Because nature has on many heights<lb/>
a gallery or passage, in which lie <lb/>
all instruments of art and craft.<lb/>
All young children go through here<lb/>
even before they suckle at their Mother's breast,<lb/> 
and here, generous nature hands <lb/>
each one a particular instrument <lb/>
in order to earn his bread in the countries of the World. <lb/>

<ab>6. Various and precious are her gifts:	<lb/>
here she gives ploughs, there hammers, there axes, <lb/>
here trowels, there books, over there brushes,<lb/>
but often the unknowing parents<lb/>
distribute the natural characters <lb/>
and so, alas, sometimes it arises <lb/>
that a born painter walks behind the plow, <lb/>
and farmers devote themselves to the brush.<lb/>

Parents ought to pay careful attention to the inclinations

<ab>7. If nature does not offer you the brush, <lb/>
then you must in time turn back<lb/>
and let your fruitless desires die, <lb/>
and so save time and money, <lb/>
not ruining yourself like the gnat mentioned above.<lb/>
The bridge will be too long and narrow for you; <lb/>
There is less shame in stopping at the beginning <lb/>
than in falling at the end.<lb/>

<ab>8. If nature is friendly toward you, <lb/>
people will quickly judge the character of your mind; <lb/>
for everyone, from the cradle, <lb/>
must begin to strangle snakes, [and] later overcome <lb/>
the lions of Nemea and monsters of Crete <lb/>
or many-headed hydras of Lerna, with perilous bites, <lb/>
Cacuses, Cerberuses and cruel Centaurs, <lb/>
to have their heads crowned with green laurels.<sup><comment>4 These tasks refer to the exploits of Heracles,
 the Greek hero known for his remarkable strength, who strangled snakes as an infant and later, as an adult,
  engaged in the Twelve Labors to expiate the sin of murdering his wife and children. <b><font color="red"> Add to Note </font> </b></comment></sup> <lb/>

sting and burn early when they newly grow; <lb/>
