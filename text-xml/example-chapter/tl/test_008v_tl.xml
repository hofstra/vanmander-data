<ab>or the door which opens to many Arts: <lb/>
goldsmithing, building, and more. Indeed,<lb/>
the seven liberal Arts could not live without her;<lb/>
for the art of drawing, which embraces all things, <lb/>
holds all the Arts in her measured bonds.<sup><comment>2 The term
"matighe stringhen"
literally means “moderate strands.” I chose “measured” to echo the double meaning of
“measurable” and “moderate.” while “bounds” can refer to the reins of self-control as well as perimeter lines. As
Miedema comments, VM is evoking the allegory of self-control.

<ab>2.   She is a generous Nurse of all the arts, <lb/>
as Natalis Comes tells us.<sup><comment>3 “Quis enim audeat ipsam picturam omnium bonarum atrium
alumnam...” Natalis Comes, Mythologiae, Frankfurt, 1581, 785  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalis_Comes</comment></sup><lb/>
Yes, likewise noble and instructive Grammar, <lb/> 
was raised by her and swiftly grew, <lb/>
learning from her to recognize letters and symbols<lb/>
so that People of different languages <lb/>
harmoniously grasp one another’s intentions, <lb/>
whether they are near or far.</ab>

<margin>left-middle</margin>Painting, which exists in drawing, is the nurse of all great arts and sciences. </ab>

<ab>3.   The Perfection of the art of Drawing must derive<lb/>
from a solid intelligence, and the intelligence<lb/>
must be built up through practice<lb/>
and sustained by a natural spirit, <lb/>
which is nobly skilled at enrichment,<lb/>
and by quick attentiveness. <lb/>
Thus with good judgment the Artist creates in his mind<lb/>
a design of everything he is pleased to sketch by hand.<sup><comment>4 Compare Vasari I, <comment>43 This is a comment inside of a comment</comment> [Miedema 427]</comment></sup></ab>

<ab>4.   This Father of Painting is a remarkable<lb/>	
expression for uncovering and Clarifying<lb/>
hidden ideas–indeed, the witness<lb/>
to the intention, which consists<lb/>
steadily in tracing, sketching and defining,<lb/>
to capture everything in the World<lb/>
in the range of our vision, especially<lb/>
the Human figure, most magnificent creation.</ab>

<ab>5.   Now Youngsters, to pursue this goal, that is,<lb/>
to become competent in the art of Drawing, <lb/>
you must begin, with great dedication,<lb/>
at the oval, and drawing the cross within it; <lb/> 
to learn to draw a face deftly<lb/>
from all sides, very important: it is disgraceful<lb/>
that one sees many painters misalign the face,<lb/>
laboring in vain because they ignore the cross.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>
<lb/><lb/><lb/>
Very important to understand the oval and the cross.  </ab>

to place a figure in the proper stable position, without faltering,<lb/>
on one foot, where the weight of the body rests,<lb/>
as described in the chapter on Pose:<lb/>
let the hip swing over the standing foot.<sup><comment>5 VM is referring to contrapposto, the standard format for depicting a standing figure</comment></sup><lb/>
Now we would be very grateful to a great Master<lb/>
If he had published on your behalf, O youths,<lb/>
an illustrated ABC book introducing our Art.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>There ought to be a Book as an introduction for young Painters, for learning to place a Figure with ease, and thus leading to greater perfection. </ab>
