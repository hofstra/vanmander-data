4.  So let us now establish in an ordered manner,<lb/>
under the correct circumstances,<lb/>
precise rules and fixed Laws,<lb/>
which, through observing many aspects,<lb/>
Nature has wisely revealed to us,<lb/>
lest we unknowingly approach<lb/>
some system of poses outside of<lb/>
exact measurements, rules and statutes.<lb/>

5. To place a standing figure, we must<lb/>
draw a straight line, like a plumbline,<lb/>
downward from the top.<lb/>
This shall be like the string of a bow<lb/>
set against the outward curve of the body<lb/>
and shall descend from the pit at the throat<lb/>
to the center of the weight-bearing foot. <lb/>
Thus may we solidly construct a standing figure.<lb/>

6. For observe: a person and a column <lb/>
are comparable in stance and composition;<lb/>
and since head as the heaviest part<lb/>
is supported by the body, it is fitting<lb/>
that the foot be placed underneath it as a Base,<lb/>
and therefore the weight-bearing foot <lb/>
carries the head so perfectly<lb/>
that one can set a plumbline between the two.<lb/>

7. This perpendicular line<lb/>
or vertical stroke that I mention<lb/>
I do not find, in fact, necessary to draw,  <lb/>
lest one become timid while drawing -<lb/>
but one should imagine it,<lb/>
and determine it securely <lb/>
so that the base of the neck, as if on a plumbline,<lb/>
aligns precisely with the center of the foot, which carries the body.<lb/>

8. For the head can move or bend toward one shoulder<lb/>
or the other, which is sometimes appropriate;<lb/>
but head and body must be placed in opposition<lb/>
to one another, or –to put it more clearly–<lb/>
the point is that one should carefully avoid<lb/>
hanging the head on the same side<lb/>
that one lets the body hang or bend.<lb/>

9. The weight-bearing foot, together with the leg,<lb/>
may extend forward, for a pleasant effect,<lb/>
but there is a natural phenomenon <lb/>
to consider, which is not only common <lb/>
in people but in four-footed animals:<lb/>
the right front leg and the rear left leg<lb/>
must lift, step and fall together,<lb/>
