Thus after the proper manner, one should rather<lb/>
Employ the arm of the higher shoulder for this,<lb/>
To avoid an ungraceful pose.<lb/>

22.  And further, to sustain a proper appearance,<lb/>
there is another matter worthy of concern<lb/>
by bold minds, who notice everything,<lb/>
to wit: figures which are not in action<lb/>
should not raise both hands or arms<lb/>
at the same time; it is good to recognize<lb/>
that variation offers delight.<lb/>
One should also avoid this with the legs and feet.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
One should not have both arms or legs performing the same action, unless the action of the figure requires it.

23. Further, it seems that cannot stop<lb/>
and rest their spirits, as they work,<lb/>
without allowing (with permission) breasts and buttocks<lb/>
to be seen at the same time; it seems such people<lb/>
want to be in the park with the theatrical players<lb/>
who consider unnatural things such as<lb/>
jumping and tumbling as art;<lb/>
but painters should be on guard against this.<lb/>

24. Yes, ordinary folk speak ill of those<lb/>
who hope to embellish their work in this way,<lb/>
concocting impossible things:<lb/>
distorted, twisted, the limbs broken,<lb/>
what the Italians call <i>stropiato</i>.<lb/>
There are more examples of this to be wary of,<lb/>
Such as the hand twisted and forced onto the arm,<lb/>
And the foot wrenched contrary to the knee.<lb/>
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>One should not distort the limbs of a figure too much.<sup><comment>1 note: Miedema 455: a common complaint about 16th c. Italian art, which, via VM, ended up as a complaint about some Dutch stuff too.</comment></sup></ab>

25. Thus one must keep to moderation<lb/>
in turning and bending, according to real life:<lb/>
in a face upturned in distress,<lb/>
do not let the head hang back <lb/>
too far to allow the eyes to point<lb/>
directly toward heaven; and then <lb/>
in a figure stooping low, do not allow<lb/>
the shoulders to reach the navel.<lb/>

26. One should also not turn the head further<lb/>
that when the chin is directly over the armpit;<lb/>
though arms and legs are somewhat freer,<lb/>
as we observe, raising either hand so high<lb/>
that the elbows are higher than<lb/>
the armpits, is nothing to praise.<lb/>
These rules and others like them<lb/>
Nature upholds with an affirming seal.<lb/>
