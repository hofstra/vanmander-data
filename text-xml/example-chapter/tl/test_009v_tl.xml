<ab>your hand loose without being labored,<sup><comment>10 Vasari I, 44.</comment></sup><lb/> 
and your eyes begin to gain insight,<lb/>
then go from design<sup><comment>11 VM’s term is versiering, ornament or design</comment></sup> to reality, that is, to life,<lb/>
which is most beneficial to us, <lb/>
in which an easy grace, simple and direct, <lb/>
is manifested in both stillness and motion.<lb/>
Let it be your Lodestar, guiding the ship.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>One must work a great deal from life. In life there is a sure, simple ease.</ab>

<ab>14. This is the target to aim for, the foundation for building.<lb/>
No Text is better to quote, <lb/>
no example is surer and finer to trust,<lb/>
than the perfect nudity of Man and Woman.<lb/>
The most learned Books to study<lb/>
are this: to practice them endlessly, <lb/>
as well as nudes of Children, and all Animals.<lb/>
Otherwise it will be impossible to draw.<sup><comment>12 “versieren” again - drawing as design and ornament.</comment></sup></ab> 


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Life: the guiding star, foundation stone, and goal of Painting.<sup><comment>13 VM’s term is

<ab>15. It is astonishing what grace one sees <lb/>
Nature pour forth in all directions. Here,<lb/>
to our delight, can be found everything <lb/>
we might lack: gestures, composition, <lb/>
good foreshortening, contour, and substance.<lb/>
Through much working and reworking, over a long time,<lb/>
one becomes experienced as a worthy Master<lb/>
But one must also learn to work from memory.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>In life one finds everything.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>One must work from memory to acquire invention.</ab>

<ab>16. Invention must also develop from youth,<lb/>
otherwise we would compose poorly,<lb/>
and then would have to consult another person’s work.<sup><comment>14 VM uses the metaphor of a vineyard - i.e. using another vintner’s stock.</comment></sup><lb/>
We must also pay attention to proportion<lb/>
as we enlarge or decrease,<lb/>
and especially we must remember<lb/>
what we draw, to gain more wisdom.<lb/>
For you see, Memory is the mother of the Muses.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Memoria, mother of the Muses, named Mnemosyne; see Plutarch in his De liberis educandis.<sup><comment>15 Plutarch, Moralia

<ab>17. Further, it is the treasure-house of knowledge.<lb/>
But as you copy,<sup><comment>16 VM’s term is "conterfeyten", which is imitating, copying, mimicking. See Mediema 435 - 36 on this term and its uses and history</comment></sup> pay attention <lb/> 
to placing your model correctly,<lb/>
for many a Painter has committed an error<lb/>
by placing it too high, too low, or too close.<lb/>
Some use screens and nets,<lb/>
Or frames with threads stretched cross-wise,<lb/>
In order to prevent faults in copying.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>The model–that is, the nude–which one plans to copy, should not be placed too close.</ab>

<ab>18. This is the Veil which I pass over in my chapter on composition,<lb/> 
although I want to leave anyone free <lb/>
to use it, or any other materials;<lb/>
for it matters not how one wants to bring his work <lb/>
to grace and to correct proportion.<lb/>
Further, it greatly benefits the art of drawing<lb/>
to have a good understanding<lb/>
of where the Muscles begin or end<lb/> 
by observing corpses being flayed.<sup><comment>17 VM may be referring to the use of an
ecorché or flayed figure, a mannequin designed for the study of anatomy.
A print by Stradanus after Cornelis Cort of an idealized artist’s studio shows an
ecorché suspended from a beam. These models were made of bronze, wood and plaster. one Italian example, made in about 1598 by Ludovico Cigoli, is in the
Victoria and Albert museum . . See The Nude and the Norm (and other sources) on learning anatomy through this means.
He may also be alluding to the practice of using actual corpses. Miedema: In the Netherlands it was difficult to
acquire anatomical knowledge from direct observation. VM tells of the horrible journey of Aert Mijtens to steal a corpse
from the gallows for that purpose. (see Miedema on Lives.)</comment></sup> </ab>	

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>This veil is a frame with threads strung in rows, which one also draws on the paper
to place the model correctly, seeing it through the veil. </ab>
