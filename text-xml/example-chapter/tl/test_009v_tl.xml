<ab>your hand loose without being labored,<sup>10</sup> 
and your eyes begin to gain insight,
then go from design<sup>11</sup> to reality, that is, to life,
which is most beneficial to us, 
in which an easy grace, simple and direct, 
is manifested in both stillness and motion.
Let it be your Lodestar, guiding the ship.</ab>




<ab>One must work a great deal from life. In life there is a sure, simple ease.</ab>

<ab>14. This is the target to aim for, the foundation for building.
No Text is better to quote, 
no example is surer and finer to trust,
than the perfect nudity of Man and Woman.
The most learned Books to study
are this: to practice them endlessly, 
as well as nudes of Children, and all Animals.
Otherwise it will be impossible to draw.<sup>12</sup></ab> 


<ab>Life: the guiding star, foundation stone, and goal of Painting.<sup>13</sup></ab>

<ab>15. It is astonishing what grace one sees 
Nature pour forth in all directions. Here,
to our delight, can be found everything 
we might lack: gestures, composition, 
good foreshortening, contour, and substance.
Through much working and reworking, over a long time,
one becomes experienced as a worthy Master
But one must also learn to work from memory.</ab>

<ab>In life one finds everything.</ab>





<ab>One must work from memory to acquire invention.</ab>

<ab>16. Invention must also develop from youth,
otherwise we would compose poorly,
and then would have to consult another person’s work.<sup>14</sup>
We must also pay attention to proportion
as we enlarge or decrease,
and especially we must remember
what we draw, to gain more wisdom.
For you see, Memory is the mother of the Muses.</ab>






<ab>Memoria, mother of the Muses, named Mnemosyne; see Plutarch in his De liberis educandis.<sup>15</sup></ab>

<ab>17. Further, it is the treasure-house of knowledge.
But as you copy,<sup>16</sup> pay attention  
to placing your model correctly,
for many a Painter has committed an error
by placing it too high, too low, or too close.
Some use screens and nets,
Or frames with threads stretched cross-wise,
In order to prevent faults in copying.</ab>



<ab>The model–that is, the nude–which one plans to copy, should not be placed too close.</ab>

<ab>18. This is the Veil which I pass over in my chapter on composition, 
although I want to leave anyone free 
to use it, or any other materials;
for it matters not how one wants to bring his work 
to grace and to correct proportion.
Further, it greatly benefits the art of drawing
to have a good understanding
of where the Muscles begin or end 
by observing corpses being flayed.<sup>17</sup> </ab>	

<ab>This veil is a frame with threads strung in rows, which one also draws on the paper
to place the model correctly, seeing it through the veil. </ab>
