<ab>19. It is absolutely necessary to comprehend<lb/> 
the entirely of the nude figure, in every aspect,<lb/>
though in so doing, one must make sure<lb/>
not to depict the Muscles or Sinews <lb/>
too starkly; otherwise our Figures will seem<lb/>
to waste away from scrawniness.<lb/>
One should not thoughtlessly neglect<lb/>
the plump and smooth softness of a living body. </ab>

let your lines increase from thin to heavy,<lb/>
that is, draw them from the top down,<lb/>
taking care to portray the muscles or other things<lb/>
as if all the Graces are there at play.<sup><comment>18 That is, beautifully. The Graces (Gratien)
refers to three minor goddesses of Greek mythology known as the charites or graces,
named Aglaea ("Splendor"), Euphrosyne ("Mirth"), and Thalia ("Good Cheer") representing various aspects of
inspiration, creativity and pleasure. They are traditionally depicted as three standing female nudes, embracing or with
arms linked, often with the center figure facing the opposite direction</comment></sup></ab>

With these one can mimic the shapes of nature;<lb/>
indeed, one can represent color in all figures<lb/>

to all estates, whether young or old,<lb/>
indeed, princes, generals and soldiers,<lb/>
whether to speak of art with knowledge in these matters<lb/>
or to indicate fortifications and towns. <lb/>
Therefore the noble art of drawing is to be praised,<lb/>
from which we will continue to Proportion.</ab>
