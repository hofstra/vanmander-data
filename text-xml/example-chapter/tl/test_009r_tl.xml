<ab>are unwilling. I fear the censure
and they, the effort. So, honorable Youth, 
you remain deprived of a useful thing. 
In the old days, now long gone, 
our art was contained in several books
that one now would search for in vain.</ab>


<ab>8. In Books, Youths in School learn 
the seven liberal Arts; young Apothecaries
and Surgeons are taught sufficiently
through writings and books not to make mistakes.
Yet for you, young Painters, there was nothing reliable
in our language, to fill you like new Vessels
with useful, edifying substance, 
from which you can preserve a strong scent.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>In earlier times there was nothing written in our language for the instruction of Painters.</ab>

<ab>9. Therefore, first it would be good to find 
a good Master, to acquire a good style,<sup>6</sup>
and to learn thoroughly the solid foundations

according to the inclination of your mind.
With fiery effort  you must train your hand
by copying in Charcoal and Chalk on ash grey

the highlights and darks touch each other;

<ab>11. Be diligent and avoid using too much highlight.
When you use colored inks or wash,
always try for a soft blending. 
Or when you work with charcoal and chalk, keep a wad

or from immovable plaster casts.<sup>8</sup>

for example, those of the renowned Parmigianino<sup>9</sup>

and note well how you place the fall of light,
because the highlights are very expressive. </ab>
