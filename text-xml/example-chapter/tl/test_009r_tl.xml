<ab>are unwilling. I fear the censure<lb/>
and they, the effort. So, honorable Youth, <lb/>
you remain deprived of a useful thing. <lb/>
In the old days, now long gone, <lb/>
our art was contained in several books<lb/>
that one now would search for in vain.</ab>


<ab>8. In Books, Youths in School learn <lb/>
the seven liberal Arts; young Apothecaries<lb/>
and Surgeons are taught sufficiently<lb/>
through writings and books not to make mistakes.<lb/>
Yet for you, young Painters, there was nothing reliable<lb/>
in our language, to fill you like new Vessels<lb/>
with useful, edifying substance, <lb/>
from which you can preserve a strong scent.</ab>


<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>In earlier times there was nothing written in our language for the instruction of Painters.</ab>

<ab>9. Therefore, first it would be good to find <lb/>
a good Master, to acquire a good style,<sup><comment>6 Miedema 430 on VM’s term
manier and “maniera”, etc.</comment></sup><lb/>
and to learn thoroughly the solid foundations <lb/>
in design, execution, outlining, modeling, <lb/>
and the placement of light and shadows<lb/>
first with Charcoal then with Chalk or Pen,<lb/>
to draw the light places delicately so one can hardly see them,<lb/> 
and to press harder where the shadows fall. </ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>It is useful for students to start with a good Master. </ab>

<ab>10. You  may do anything, hatching and washes, <lb/>
according to the inclination of your mind.<lb/>
With fiery effort  you must train your hand<lb/>
by copying in Charcoal and Chalk on ash grey<lb/>
or pale blue Paper in order to highlight <lb/>
and darken. But take care not to let<lb/>
the highlights and darks touch each other;<lb/>
keep the ground color between the two. </ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>Drawing on colored paper is very beneficial to highlights and darkening.</ab>


<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>Do not bring highlights and darkening next to each other.</ab>

<ab>11. Be diligent and avoid using too much highlight.<lb/>
When you use colored inks or wash,<lb/>
always try for a soft blending.<lb/> 
Or when you work with charcoal and chalk, keep a wad<lb/>
of cotton nearby,<sup><comment>7 Literally, a stick or shaft of cotton.</comment></sup> until the middle tones <lb/> 
blend on both sides, whether you work from prints <lb/>  
or from immovable plaster casts.<sup><comment>8 On working with plaster casts: Miedema 434</comment></sup><lb/>
Everyone likes to work as he is inclined.</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>It is good to work from prints or other methods using darkening and highlights, 
as well as from plaster casts.
Highlight has a strong effect in drawing.</ab>

<ab>12. Good prints with ground tints and effective highlights<lb/>
have opened the eyes of many a mind;<lb/>
for example, those of the renowned <comment>Parmigianino<figure><id>Parm.Carpi_Diogenes</id></figure><a href="http://localhost:4000/vanmander/figures/images/Parm.Carpi_Diogenes.jpg" target="_blank">Link to Full Size Image</a></comment> <lb/>	
and others.<sup><comment>9 Miedema notes the influence of Parmigianino’s prints, transmitted via Bartholom
eus Spranger, on the art milieu of the Prague and Vienna courts.
Miedema II, 434</comment></sup> Thus, in order to be fruitful in art,<lb/>
graft to your spirit such crops as these;<lb/>
Or work after something good cast in plaster,<lb/> 
and note well how you place the fall of light,<lb/>
because the highlights are very expressive. </ab>
