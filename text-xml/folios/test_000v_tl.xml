<ab><b>Preface to the Foundation of the Noble Liberal Art of Painting.</b>
<lb/>
<lb/>
The greatly diverting and noble art of Painting, which generates intelligence, 
natural Nurse of all worthy Arts and sciences (as those sufficiently Learned in letters are 
aware) was always held in great esteem by most Gentlemen and highly learned men. 
Indeed, the wise ancient Greeks held such respect for her that in the time of the artful 
Painter <i>Pamphilus</i>, they gave her the same level or position of honor as the other liberal 
Arts. <lb/>
<lb/>
But whether, either in or through this association, our excellent art of Painting has 
not, by her worthy presence, by her appearance, brings more honor to the other arts than 
she has received by the dignity of their company: I prefer to keep my feelings to myself, 
so as not to be rebuked with stormy looks, to be thought of unfavorably, or to cause much 
confusion. Nonetheless it cannot be denied that, if she is worthy of her place among the 
others, from which she has never been excluded by anyone, then she may well and 
properly be called liberal. <lb/>
<lb/>
Her nobility and high worth have been confirmed by many great monuments and 
deeds in antiquity. First, the other liberal Arts have never been esteemed anywhere to the 
point where it is forbidden to teach them to common folk: this was the case with the art of 
Painting, which no one except those of Noble birth were permitted to learn. Furthermore, 
the law of the Roman Emperor Justinian [<i>Institutes</i> Book 2, paragraph 27.]  states that a 
painted board, or panel, is the property of the artful Painter, and follows him, if he has 
painted on it. On the other hand, the Parchment or Paper does not come into the 
possession of a clever writer even if he has written on it with Letters of gold; it continues 
to belong to the owner.<lb/>
<lb/>
We must also note what beautiful and magnificent trophies adorn our <i>Pictura</i>. 
Straightaway one sees here the worldly scepter of the great <i>Alexander</i> united with 
<i>Apelles’</i> Brush, bound together and hanging: there, the beautiful <i>Campaspe</i> is presented 
to the Painter. Elsewhere, the gold of the Lydian King <i>Candaules</i> is weighed against the 
paintings of <i>Bularchus</i>; here the wealth of Cities, against the paintings of <i>Apelles</i>, <i>Echin</i>, 
<i>Melanthys</i>, and <i>Nicomachus</i>. There, against a painting in four colors by <i>Apelles</i>, stands a 
hundredweight of gold, and elsewhere lie eighty talents’ worth of gold for a <i>Medea and 
Ajax</i>, painted by <i>Timomachus</i><sup><comment>1 None of these works survive; they, and the works referred 
to below, are known chiefly through Pliny the Elder</comment></sup>. <lb/>
<lb/>
Still further off lie a hundred Talents for a painting by the artful <i>Aristides</i> of 
<i>Thebes</i>, bought at an auction; and further, King <i>Attalus</i>, distressed because a painted 
<i>Bacchus</i> was refused and denied to him in exchange for six thousand Sesterces.  Behold, 
still more astonishing: there is an unfinished canvas, barely drawn on by <i>Apelles</i> and 
<i>Protogenes</i>, which is more highly valued than all the treasures in the Palace of <i>Caesar</i>. It 
is also glorious, and praiseworthy, that three Cities, <i>Rhodes</i>, <i>Ciconia</i>,  and <i>Syracuse</i>, 
thank our Art with great respect, that she was not bloodily destroyed through cruel <i>Mars</i> 
and raging <i>Bellona</i>.  This is all excellent evidence.<lb/>
<lb/>
But whoever wants more recent proof need only go (if there is the opportunity), 
to Prague, where there is the greatest lover of painting in the world–that is, the Roman 
<i>Caesar Rudolf</i> the second–in order to see all the magnificent costly pieces in his imperial 
residence and elsewhere, in all the art chambers of the most powerful amateurs. He must 
examine, evaluate, and calculate the value and price of each, to see what considerable 
sum he will find<sup><comment>2 On Rudolf’s collection, see <a href="http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/kunst-und-wunderkammer-emperor-rudolf-ii"

 I think that, in his surprise, he will be compelled to admit that our 
painting is a noble, excellent, magnificent and virtuous exercise, which should not yield 
to any other Natural or liberal Art. <lb/>
<lb/>
I myself (for what it is worth) am a Practitioner, a follower of this most laudable 
Art, who hopes that she (however worthy), shall not find me unworthy to set forth her 
foundation, nature, form and being (as much as I can) for her clever, beloved, youthful 
Followers. To this I am willingly inclined, the more so, since I have not seen or heard 
anyone in our own time who has taken in hand this important and agreeable subject for 
the benefit of the Youth who love art. <lb/>
<lb/>
Moreover, I am tempted by a bold desire to follow in this the prominent, great and 
most illustrious <i>Apelles</i>, <i>Antigonus</i>, <i>Xenocrates</i>, and others, our ancient precursors, who 
(as will be heard) have laid open all the mysteries of Art in books and in writing (after 
their knowledge) before the eyes of young Painters. Someone more expert in speech 
could have accomplished this in much finer and more artful language; yet it could be 
feared that, if he himself were not a Painter, he would make frequent errors regarding our 
particulars and our business. <lb/>
<lb/>
This happened in antiquity to <i>Phormio</i>, the Peripatetic philosopher in Ephesus, 
who with powerful eloquence, wished to describe all the virtuous aspects and knowledge 
that an excellent Commander must have; but whose argument <i>Hannibal</i>, the great warrior 
at the time, laughed at because of the great arrogance and ignorance he observed in the 
Man.  <lb/>
<lb/>
Thus, seeing no-one enriched by this desire to write or by diligence, and rather 
than waiting in vain for another, I have over some Years begun setting forth these 
foundations of the art of Painting in rhymed poetry in Flemish, since Young people are 
often drawn to poetry, finding it easier to learn by heart and to remember. <lb/>
<lb/>
At the beginning I did not have a proper understanding of French poetic meter, 
yet I am not pleased by our own old limping style. I say “limping,” because we did not 
use lines of a single meter. Therefore I have followed the Italian <i>ottava</i>, then used our 
own rhyme scheme. I have used no rhymes of one syllable, nor those in which the final 
syllables rhyme, which are called <i>Masculin</i> by the French, and which I call in Flemish, 
“standing rhymes;” but I have everywhere rhymed the penultimate syllable, which I call 
“falling,” and the French call <i>Feminin</i>. I have also avoided rhyming the third from the 
last syllable, which I call “stumbling” after the Italian, in which they are called <i>Druccioli</i>. 
I have avoided using the same rhyme within a hundred lines, though with digressions and 
other things I might well have trespassed in this. Foreign words I have not completely 
avoided, since sometimes in our profession we use words which would otherwise sound 
incorrect. <lb/>
<lb/>
Perhaps it might be pleasing to those who know about Poetry if I had composed 
my poem in French meter; but this would have been too difficult for me, and too obscure 
for Young people to understand. I concede that one could compose something good with 
Alexandrines, in the Gallic manner, but it requires great concentration and time to fill it 
with fine material while still flowing. I also consider it very fine and melodious to make 
the second syllable strong or long, and the first one short, such as that used first in our 
language by the great Poet Heer <i>Jan van Hout</i>, Pensionary of the city of Leiden, who in 
his youth observed this in <i>Petrarch</i>, <i>Ronsard</i>, and others, and imitated them.<lb/>
<lb/>
As I begin to discuss the art of Poetry, I wish to state in brief (if appropriate 
here) my feelings and desires about this, that is, about the French style and meter up 
and coming with us, offering some examples of good and bad verse.  First, from the 
Community of ten and eleven syllables, this line of eleven, with its feminine or 
falling rhyme, sounds good to me:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote>
<i>Schoon jonghe Ieught, Meestersse van mijn leven.</i><lb/>
[beautiful young maid, Mistress of my life]<lb/>
</blockquote>
<lb/>
<lb/>
Good, because within the first four syllables before the caesura is one 
complete idea, and descriptive words are next to its word of substance, which 
in Latin is called <i>Adiectivum</i> next to the <i>Substantivum</i>. Furthermore, because 
the latter part of the line contains a complete meaning on its own, without 
having to rely on the next part. <lb/>
<lb/>
The following, of ten syllables, with a standing rhyme, is not so good:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote>
	<i>Een Man die wel ervaren is ter Zee.</i><lb/>
	[A Man well experienced at Sea]<lb/>
</blockquote>
Because the part before the caesura at wel must rely on the second. <lb/>
<lb/>
Now, concerning the six-foot Alexandrines, of twelve and thirteen syllables, which have a caesura on the sixth, I think this line of thirteen is good: <lb/>
<lb/> 
<blockquote>
	<i>In Gods gheplanten Hof, in't lustigh Ooftigh Eden.</i><lb/>
	[In the Garden planted by God, in the lovely Eden of the East]<lb/>
</blockquote>
Because the part before the caesura, and the entirety, contain a full, complete idea. <lb/>
<lb/>
This one, of twelve, is quite poor, or bad:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote>
<i>Daerom ick bidd' u, wilt noch lijdtsaem wesen: want.</i><lb/>
[I implore you, be patient still: for]<lb/>
</blockquote>
Because the first part before the caesura relies on <i>noch lijdtsaem wesen</i>; also because the 
whole line is neither completed nor comprehensible; and because want must rely on the 
following line. Therefore <i>want</i>, and <i>maer</i>, and suchlike should not stand before the 
caesura or pause, nor rhyme at the end of the line, if one wishes to make a good poem.
Furthermore, the last line, except for the word <i>lijdsaem</i>, contains nothing other than 
common everyday talk, which Alexandrines easily lend themselves to because of their 
length, if they are not governed by judgment. But the previous lines of thirteen is full of 
fine substantive words and descriptive words, free of everyday talk. I consider these 
examples, and few words, enough to make my opinion known. <lb/>
<lb/>
However, there are some more things used by our Netherlandish Poets which 
displease me and cannot be justified.  Not paying attention to the assimilation of vowels, 
they place a word ending in a short vowel next to another beginning with a short vowel, 
as can be found in the syllables of the line, thereby ignoring assimilation, especially if it 
suits them: as, for example, one might say, “<i>de achste</i>, <i>de elfste</i>, <i>de ander</i>, <i>geacht</i>, and 
suchlike. But if one says <i>te eer</i>, <i>de eerste</i>, <i>te hebben</i>,  and so forth, where a short vowel 
precedes a long double one, I think no assimilation should follow at all;  also, the aspirant h 
next to the vowel should have the same value as the second vowel. <lb/>
<lb/>
Now, I would like to see a general conformity of gender, number, and similar 
elements, such as those used by the French and other nations. For they address a Man as 
<i>Seigneur</i>, and <i>Signor</i>, while we say <i>Heer</i>, and an elder man<i> Heere</i>, <i>Siel</i>, and <i>Siele</i>, <i>Eeer</i>, and 
<i>Eere</i> and so on, changing them to suit us in syllable or rhyme.  This matter, and more, 
will be resolved slowly, for I find many faults, (from which I cannot boast I am free) 
which should be improved.  I leave it and trust to those experts who work on this. <lb/>
<lb/>
I turn now to my young Painters, whom I intend to teach to paint, not to write 
poetry. Therefore I say that, if there are competent and perspicacious young minds 
attracted by learning our art of painting–and whose souls, when they were joined to the 
body as well as to the life force, descended from the heights and passed at the right 
moment by the spheres of the stars that bestow intelligence; or in their first breath 
they breathe in from these beneficial bodies a strong inclination to be skilled in Painting, to 
speak in a scientific manner–these spirits will be able to accept with gratitude what I offer 
them so willingly, and be attentive, with awakened intelligence, to all the instructive 
subjects that I propose to them in my foundation of the Art of Painting, or in the entire 
Painter’s Book. I hope that the advantage or profit is not small for them. <lb/>
<lb/>
To this end, I shall gladly speak to them with a willing heart and give them 
courage. Just as the commanders of ancient Rome observed from the spear-shaking of 
their warriors that their boldness was brought to life by eloquent oration: so I hope that 
they will gather fearlessly and attack first the most important element of the Arts, namely, 
to learn to pose a Human figure. Then, they become familiar with all the other aspects of 
Art, or, if Nature and the Spirit do not allow it, to excel in with at least one aspect.  For it 
does not happen every day, that by oneself one can be instructed, learn and comprehend, 
or achieve excellence, in everything.<lb/>
<lb/>
This is how it happened in our Art, since old or Ancient times: that one was more 
competent in one area, and another was a better Master in another area, as we shall see in 
their biographies. For <i>Apollodorus</i> concentrated in particular on beauty. <i>Zeuxis</i> made heads 
which were too large but was a fine painter of Fruit. <i>Eumarus</i> was skilled at making 
everything from life. <i>Protogenes</i> could only paint ships. <i>Apelles</i> did everything with grace.  
<i>Parrhasius</i> was good at contour drawing. <i>Demon</i>, full of invention; <i>Tymanthes</i>, intelligence: 
in his work there was always a hidden idea or meaning. <i>Pamphilus</i> was learned; 
<i>Nicomachus</i>, swift. <i>Athenion</i>, profound.<i> Nicophanes</i>, neat and clean; <i>Amulius</i>, good at 
colors. <i>Pausias</i>, skilled at children and flowers. <i>Asclepiodorus</i>, good at measure, or 
proportion. <i>Amphyon</i>, good at composition. <i>Serapio</i>, skilled in large works, and <i>Pyreicus</i>, 
in small; <i>Anthiphilus</i>,in large and small. <i>Dionisius</i> could paint only Human figures.  
<i>Euphranor</i> could paint all subjects. <i>Nicias</i>, animals, especially Dogs. <i>Nicophanes</i> was 
skilled at copying and clean in his work. <i>Mechopanes</i> made his colors too harsh. <i>Nealces</i> 
was skilled at depiction. <i>Aristides</i>, at emotions. <i>Clesides</i>, at working from life as well as from 
memory; and <i>Ludius</i>, at Landscape.  <lb/>
<lb/>
We would find the same differences among today’s Italians and 
Netherlanders–too long to discuss here–by which Youth shall learn to 
persevere in Art, and to seize upon that which Nature offers him most. Failing 
to achieve perfection in the painting of figures and histories, one could paint 
Animals, Kitchen scenes, Fruits, Flowers, Landscapes, Architecture, 
Perspectives, Cartouches, Grotesques, Night scenes, Fires, Portraits from life, 
Seascapes, and Ships, or still more subjects.<lb/>
<lb/>
But above all, everyone must ardently and passionately strive to grasp 
the supreme mastery of our art, which can be achieved without danger, 
without war or bloodshed, only on condition of coming to the aid of generous 
Nature, earnestly and with constant diligence. I want to encourage our dear 
Young Painters with a warm, joyful and stimulating exhortation, and to advise 
them at the same time never to become distant or depart from virtue, honor, 
kindness and civility, which must be companions of the constant, faithful and 
intimate Arts, for all noble and fine spirits. Farewell.<lb/>
