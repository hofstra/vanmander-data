74. Just as Herodianus has written,<lb/> 
his topmost half is naked, and in order to depict<lb/> 
some concealment/mystery, <lb/> 
his very long hair and beard hang down below.<lb/> 
On his body and legs sit, as if playing,<lb/> 
sixteen children, as tall as an arm<lb/> 
from hand to elbow;<lb/> 
the explanation comes from Philostratus.<lb/>

he considers these children,<lb/> 
how the Nile flows in such manner<lb/> 
that it floods over Egypt,<lb/> 
high over the edges of its banks<lb/> 
to sixteen elbows or Cubits,<lb/>

that the Nile floods reach such a number. <lb/>

76. It happened once a year at a certain time,<lb/> 
but is the number is four Cubits less<lb/> 
the people of Egypt are not happy,<lb/> 
for on both banks they are expecting<lb/> 
the burden of a period of higher prices<lb/> 
during the following Year.<lb/> 
Thus the sixteenth of the Children<lb/> 
was depicted sitting high upon his Cornucopia<lb/> 
as this was the measure of a fruitful Year.<lb/>

the horn of plenty, rich with fruit,<lb/> 
with his left arm leaning on a beast<lb/> 
which many have incorrectly thought to be a Sphinx,<lb/> 
being like a Lion behind, and a maiden in front;<lb/> 
but it means that this earthly <lb/> 
occurs in the land when the course of the Sun<lb/> 
has reached Leo and Virgo.<lb/>

various crops which are found in the morasses:<lb/> 
reeds, papyrus, trees, Colocasium,<lb/> 
and various Animals who eat them,<lb/> 
such as hippopotami who splash about in that water,<lb/> 
with horsesâ€™ backs and long manes,<lb/> 
and with tails and teeth like wild boars,<lb/> 
blunt snouts, and cloven hoofs like Oxen.<lb/>

79. Then also Indian rats, Ibises, and Skinks,<lb/> 
and above them, those small misshapen dwarves,<lb/> 
Tentyrites from the Egyptian Provinces,<lb/>

That they must give way and hide themselves<lb/> 
before these celebrated lionhearted Heroes.<lb/>
