9. Purple next to green has no ill grace,<lb/>
Blue and purple greet each other well,<lb/>
but red does not sit so well near flesh tone,<lb/>
for the nude prefers to converse<lb/>
with green, blue, or purple if they meet.<lb/>
Blue is good next to green, if one is attentive<lb/>
to softening the transitions.  One will do well<lb/>
working with different reds or yellows.<lb/>

10. That is, rosy yellow and greenish yellow<lb/>
next to one another, and blue-purple  <lb/>
and reddish purple, or other mixtures.<lb/>
But Bruegel, whose works are full of life,<lb/>
often made Fabrics in different half tonesâ€“<lb/>
yes, shadowed almost without shadow,<lb/>
and among all those muted tones, <lb/>
a blooming azure, or red glowing like fire.<lb/>

11. This is like the Poets, who sometimes<lb/>
compose long discourses and histories<lb/>
to delight us by tickling our ears,<lb/>
and in the meantime, slip in<lb/>
a Saying full of sense, worthy of pondering.<lb/>
Or more precisely, it is like the Peacock, <lb/>
with its lovely feathers, or Indian Birds, <lb/>
outstanding among other Birds.<lb/>

12. On occasion we might make use of this.<lb/>
I recall that a group of young Painters<lb/>
were working in the Belvedere Palace.<lb/>
<i>Raffaelino da Reggio</i> used many pale half tones<lb/>
for his figures, unlike the bright colors sought by others;<lb/>
but no honey-seeking Bees could rush to the Thyme<lb/>
as fast our eyes fly happily to his works,<lb/>
before looking at others.<lb/>

13. I could speak of more conditions<lb/>
in varying colors which the Painter<lb/>
will encounter along the way at some time:<lb/>
to know how to distinguish the ground color <lb/>
in nudes and clothing, according to their natures.<lb/>
That also to place all objects in proper contrast<lb/>
in Landscape and architecture,<lb/>
in order to combine all colors well.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>To allow contrast.</ab>

14. However, after what you have read, take from it<lb/>
and embellish as you think best.<lb/>
Indeed, this great work often makes me lose heart,<lb/>
and I gaze, like Phaeton in his chariot,<lb/>
sometimes to the East, sometimes to the West,<lb/>
to see if, after a long race, I may not at last<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>I long for the end of this difficult work.</ab>
