<ab>
always depict the outer garment or cloak, <lb/>
Woman’s or Man’s, in a thicker fabric <lb/>
than any garment worn underneath.<lb/>
Now, my feeling: I find it a great pleasure <lb/>
to behold the flowing drapery of Lucas van Leyden,<lb/>
if what is modern there is quite distinct.<lb/>

8. I do not counsel against much study<lb/>
in learning to make all varieties of kinds<lb/>
of Cloth from life; there was no end to this<lb/>
for Lucas, as anyone has attested<lb/>
who knew this man of wide renown. <lb/>
Yet Cloth –more than foliage, hair, or beards–<lb/>
is a quest of ingenuity, an exploration of design<lb/>
in graceful arranging, gathering, and binding.<lb/>

9. A drape should not be shortened to hang<lb/>
to the loins, nor should it fall unevenly.<lb/>
Pay attention to the way folds tighten and protrude,<lb/>
move in and out, dissolve, appear foreshortened<lb/>
according to their nature.<lb/>
And here, do not forget the seven directions <lb/>
or movements which I have mentioned elsewhere,<lb/>
which will help us understand how much to gather.<lb/>

10. Above all, to know where the limbs<lb/>
of the Body fold or bend, when leaning forward, <lb/>
where the thighs are attached to the pelvis;<lb/>
likewise when kneeling, the folds of the ham,<lb/>
armpits, elbows and other parts;<lb/>
there, freely gather your Fabric into folds,<lb/>
But let it stretch tightly across the lap<lb/>
Between the knees, which are spread wide.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>Where the cloth must fold and crease.</ab>

11. For anything that is round and protruding,<lb/>
that is, shoulders, thighs, knees, belly, calves, or buttocks,<lb/>
 there one should let [the cloth] rise up and round.<lb/>
Do not add folds there, for the light surfaces<lb/>
permit no strong contrast of a dark tone;<lb/>
next to it, in the shadow, it will do no harm.<lb/>
If you add many wrinkles, bunching or pinching <lb/>
the material, no one will disapprove.<lb/>
</ab>

<margin>right-middle</margin>Where the body or limbs have volume, avoiding folds, but instead letting [the cloth] lie flat, to prevent contrast in the illuminated places.</ab>

12. Just like branches on a Tree,<lb/>
 let your folds grow out of one another.<lb/>
Avoid pocket folds, so that when unfolding <lb/>
the Cloth, pockets would not be found <lb/>
if they are made to stretch out or stiffen.<lb/>
And make it so that one always can see <lb/>
where your folds or gathers begin and end,<lb/>
just as one sees in life.<lb/>
