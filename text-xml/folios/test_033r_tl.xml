47. The other [Haarlem painter] was accustomed by Nature<lb/>
to practice Drawing and Engraving,<lb/>
and finally Painting, which has made him known<lb/>
as a <i>Phoenix</i> with golden feathers.<lb/>
What metal would not yield to gold?<lb/>
What light resembles the Sun?<lb/>
He is devoted to his practice<lb/>
and bears the name of the Victory tree.<lb/>

48. By this artist this one saw a drawing<lb/>
on Attalus skin, decorated with grapes, showing<lb/>
The Inventor of Wine, Giver of Pleasure, Dispeller of Care,<lb/>
along with Abundance. Lest they freeze in the midst <lb/>
of their joy, Desire, accompanied with white Doves,<lb/>
is blowing on a fire, causing the flames to leap;<lb/>
wherever Reflection or <i>Echo</i> strikes<lb/>
brings a shimmer to the Figures.<lb/>

49. This <i>Daedalus</i>-piece, where the lovely<lb/>
<i>Charities</i> enjoy themselves, makes the pleasure garden<lb/>
of <i>Hesperides</i> here in our own time.<lb/>
If some envy the honor of foreigners, <lb/>
the song of <i>Fame</i> will hurt them doubly.<lb/>
For it is far easier to deprecate this work<lb/>
full of the mystery of Art, equal to Zeuxisâ€™ Wrestlers,<lb/>
than to make one as beautiful.<lb/>

50.  Now having departed the dark night,<lb/>
we find ourselves where the day is in season<lb/>
and a pleasant time, in green meadows<lb/>
lying and sitting, to amuse ourselves:<lb/>
thus reflection begins to do its work,<lb/>
for we partake of the green<lb/>
from the foliage of trees, grasses, and plants <lb/>
in our faces and bare skin.<lb/>
</ab>

<margin>right-middle</margin>On the reflection of green on bare skin, when one sits in green meadows or gardens.</ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>On the reflections of nudes posed against colored objects.</ab>

51. In the same way, when faces or bare limbs<lb/>
cast shadow against wool, silk or linen,<lb/>
Reflection will achieve its essence.<lb/>
flesh color will take on yellow or red<lb/>
with such reflections.<lb/>
One also sees, where the Muscles vanish,<lb/> 
a reflection: the skin color reflection on itself.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>Large, broad reflections often create a good effect, but one must take care not to let the small reflections on nudes produce dryness or ugliness.</ab>

a backlight, as elsewhere on the bases<lb/>

with all the more contrasts, if bright objects are nearby;<lb/>
