and use in its place a very pure and light ocher;<lb/>
as I said above, this is more advisable<lb/>
than overloading oneâ€™s flesh tone<lb/>
with this heavy color that discolors the highlights<lb/>
and is bad to use, since it dries too fast.<lb/>

42. You should also renounce Minium and Spanish green,<lb/>
And Orpiment, poisonous by nature.<lb/>
I advise you to clean your Brushes well,<lb/>
or keep some for clear blue Fabric<lb/>
or Skies, and moreover, if you can do so,<lb/>
be sure to provide yourself over time<lb/>
with pure colors and learn to keep them ready,<lb/>
as one who holds art in esteem and honors it.<lb/>

43. The smalts must be well absorbed. <lb/>
To achieve this, some prick very dense holes<lb/>
In their panels with needles. <lb/>
Others cover their work with some rough paper,<lb/>
which they leave there to draw out<lb/>
the oil, and some others paint<lb/>
with Poppyseed oil, while others<lb/>
use Oil prepared according to their own experience.<lb/>

33. Because many painters spatter their nudes<lb/>
with white highlights, and are so wrong,<lb/>
so that they would no longer do so,<lb/>
there were some Writers who wished<lb/>
that Lead-white were as expensive<lb/>
as beautiful precious stones one seeks<lb/>
in far countries, in costly mines,<lb/>
or as pure Ultramarine.<lb/>

34. Now, to help understand the sense of highlights,<lb/>
I will tell what Goltzius said,<lb/>
that Titian (it is worth hearing) <lb/>
had painted in a Nativity<lb/>
a shepherd seen from the front, coming forward;<lb/>
on his forehead, to make it stand out well,<lb/>
there appeared only a single highlight<lb/>
while the rest dissolved and vanished.<lb/>

35. So the Italians are more inventive<lb/>
in their use of color than we are. Whatever we do,<lb/>
their figures are much plumper and softer<lb/>
than ours; we also have the habit of enhancing light<lb/>
