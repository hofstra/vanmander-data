<ab>Thus, in short, the youths called to the art of painting <lb/>	 
who later wish to fly over the common limits <lb/>
must rise up early<lb/>
and begin to overtake the others.<lb/>

<ab>10. Though if nature drives you to such paths that you,<lb/>
with a skilled and aspiring mind,<lb/>
have received such a part of her hand <lb/>
that you feel countless ideas <lb/>
coming alive in  your spirit, sense and inclination, <lb/>
I will not dissuade you from competing for the prize,<lb/>
because, through the adventure,<lb/>
you might succeed in the end. <lb/>

<ab>11. But let nothing distress you; <lb/>
he who persists may hope for victory. <lb/>
After the effort comes enjoyment.	<lb/>
Here sits a Popinjay<lb/>
which scarcely one in a hundred can hit;<comment>6 Literally “Here falls a parrot to be shot.” <i>Papegaai</i> (parrot) refers to the medieval and Renaissance sport of Popinjay, which involved  a contest of shooting at a stuffed and painted bird  (popinjay/papegaai/papegault) fixed atop or hanging from a long pole, tree, or tower. The game was played by archers and crossbowmen, and later, by musketeers, and considered training for warfare. The winner would be crowned “King” and awarded a “Pearl.” He had the right to lead the brotherhood in the next year’s competition; he would also be granted a tax exemption. Van Mander’s association of parrot and pearl in this stanza is interesting since it links painting to a context of competition and skill, with a valuable reward bestowing honor and social status. Miedema, 362-3, has commented on the allegorical associations of the pearl (virtue) vs. the gaudy parrot (visual splendor, especially in color). It is possible that Van Mander may have had both ideas about artistic ambition and achievement in mind. Example of a popinjay: Charles E. Grayson, Mary French, Michael J. O'Brien, Traditional Archery from Six Continents: The Charles E. Grayson Collection, University of Missouri Press, 2007, 228. J. Vandenberg, “Papegaai.” <a href="http://lietraloe.com/article/papegaai-2" title="Papegaai">Papegaai</a> Accessed July 14 2017</comment></sup>  <lb/> 
So it is that Art is always exalted, like an Ethiopian <lb/>
Eastern pearl of very great worth.<lb/>

<ab>12. Nature sometimes gives her gifts of painting  <lb/>
where there is neither the time nor means for learning,  <lb/>
but where the need pushes one to earn a living, <lb/>
so that such a noble spirit must remain buried <lb/>
like a hidden treasure; that is a shame.  <lb/>
Yet when the·gift and the means combine <lb/>
with practice, inclination and enduring industry,  <lb/>
then the work brings about pleasant profit. <lb/>

<ab>13. Now then, you young Painterly souls,<lb/>
let go of all useless childish presumptions; <lb/>
if you wish to enter the precincts of this Art, <lb/>
you must have a devoted and steadfast love for her, <lb/>
because she is jealous and must be very well served.	<lb/>
Do not cling to your featherbed; <lb/>
you must shun sleepy idleness <lb/>
as well as the bottle of Bacchus and the arrows of Cupid.<lb/>

 </ab>

Art is jealous; thus one should avoid whatever is contrary to her.

<ab>14. Always choose fellow-pupils <lb/>
from among those who exert themselves with eager diligence,<lb/>
however fine the weather is, if it thaws or freezes; <lb/>
who try never to lose time with easygoing fair-weather friends.<lb/>
Suffer for a little in order not to suffer forever.<lb/>
Offer time your time, do not squander time’s time;<lb/>
deny time your time, and time will steal your time. <lb/>
