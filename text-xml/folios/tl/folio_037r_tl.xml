32. Not built from with neat red bricks, but with clods<lb/>
of earth, reeds and straw, patches and fragments,<lb/>
and oddly plastered and smeared,<lb/>
and behind them, our blue-tinted forests<lb/>
on a ground of ash, with white strokes<lb/>
applied to the dry blue, for contrast.<lb/>
Also dried Tree trunks, finely painted,<lb/>
Bending inward, one close behind the other.<lb/>

33. The smallest Trees should be stippled.<lb/>
Yet before we rush to paint the foreground trees,<lb/>
let us, for a while, climb the steep cliffs<lb/>
where the floating clouds, with damp lips,<lb/>
spray and bathe the topmost peaks.<lb/>
In the main, their color is a sufficiently pale ash;<lb/>
sometimes their bald tips stick up<lb/>
in the middle of a dense pine forest.<lb/>

34. Indeed, among the terrible rocks which fill<lb/>
Switzerland and separate France from Italy,<lb/>
the targets of the North wind, covered with white patches–<lb/>
from these sometimes stand a few crags<lb/>
that resemble clouds, with Castles below.<lb/>
Here, O brushes, imitate like Echo<lb/>
the roar of the waters which shoot down from above,<lb/>
raging through pitted stones.<lb/>

35. Observe how the stones, like icicles,<lb/>
hang on the rocks in the waterfall,<lb/>
green with moss and irregular without order,<lb/>
the floods, as if drunk, fall in crazed courses,<lb/>
lurching and twisting over lumps and bumps<lb/>
to the bottom, resembling Snakes.<lb/>
Look how these Mastic Trees grow<lb/>
and how strangely they spread–who would ever dream it?<lb/>

36. Now, to disperse the gloom, we have arrived<lb/>
at the shadowy realm of the <i>Hamadryads</i>,<lb/>
that is, the Trees, which, if painted well,<lb/>
embellish and exalt all work;<lb/>
or if not, they will spoil it. So I must advise<lb/>
becoming accustomed to painting leaves <lb/>
in a skilled and elegant manner, with one good stroke.<lb/>
For all strength is here; this should be mastered.<lb/>

37. Overall, one should seek out many conditions<lb/>
from life, or pleasant examples,<lb/>
working steadily on prepared paper<lb/>
with ink and wash to paint growing leaves,<lb/>
hoping to achieve it in due time.<lb/>
Yet this is not like the instructive Art<lb/>
of the muscled body. For leaves, hair, air, and drapery:<lb/>
