8. Then shall I teach you to trace three circles<lb/>
of fixed measurement, such that one is the buttocks,<lb/>
the other, the breast, and let the third serve <lb/>
as the torso, then carefully create <lb/>
the arc of the neck, and show everything<lb/>
without casting off Proportion? <lb/>
Desire is light as a feather; power, as heavy as lead: <lb/>
wanting and being able do not live together in all houses.<lb/>

9. Therefore it is difficult, and I have no wish<lb/>
to endorse this measurement to you, nor to achieve<lb/>
a heavy manner. And as I teach you<lb/>
the secrets of Art without illustration,<lb/>
but alone in writing with the pen,<lb/>
I will help you understand<lb/>
the circumstances that are necessary above all.<lb/>
First, attend to the beauty of the Horse.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>My intention is to instruct without illustrations, but only in writing.</ab>

10. Pay close attention to the well-made Horse:<lb/>
the horns of the hooves gleam like agate, <lb/>
dark, smooth, high and rounded;<lb/>
his hocks short, neither too curvy nor too straight,<lb/>
forelegs long and slender to behold.<lb/>
The tendons and veins of the knees are modeled well,<lb/>
with lean muscles, indeed, so that they resemble <lb/>
nothing so much as a Deerâ€™s.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>The form and beauty of the Horse.</ab>

11. The breast should be made broad and fat,<lb/>
the shoulders and withers likewise;<lb/>
the flanks rounded, the belly short, the back without a curve,<lb/>
The barrel large, with a ridge running along it.<lb/>
The neck will appear long, wide and full of folds,<lb/>
A long mane spreads down the right side, <lb/>
The tail will hang towards the Earth,<lb/>
Or it shall be elegantly tied up. <lb/>

12. The buttocks should be round, quivering with fat,<lb/>
but the head should be small, lean and dry,<lb/>
the forehead should be made of nothing but bone,<lb/>
and the ears, sharp and never still.<lb/>
The mouth should be large, and the nostrils, and the eyes<lb/>
Also large and staring, darting here and there,<lb/>
The hair can be given the most suitable color,<lb/>
Just like many examples one has seen in life.<lb/>

13. Let us speak a little about the color.<lb/>
In his Georgics, <i>Maro</i> relates:<lb/>
chestnut, gray, these are the most magnificent;<lb/>
the white and sorrel are the.<lb/>
But Painters, learn freely all that you wish,<lb/>
and paint dappled, white, and sorrel<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>The Painter should choose his own order in coloring Horses or other Beasts.</ab>
