6. During Sunset one sees many<lb/>
different things appear red in color:<lb/>
the ground, stones and bricks,<lb/>
as well as the faces of People.<lb/>
Where the Sun’s rays strike,<lb/>
they create a clear reflection,<lb/>
at once turning a blushing red,<lb/>
fiery, and sharing in the glow.<lb/>

7. Now when <i>Phoebus</i>, with his swift Horses,<lb/>
runs to the great Ocean<lb/>
to take up his lodging under the evening star,<lb/>
one can see a shining streak in the Sea,<lb/>
spreading up toward the land.<lb/>
And in general, the water,<lb/>
like a chameleon, is wont to take on the color<lb/>
Of whatever is above or just next to it.<lb/>

8. In the Sea or the water, translucent and limpid,<lb/>
the mirror of the Sky in clear brightness,<lb/>
one sees reflected, morning and night,<lb/>
the blushing cheeks of <i>Tithonus’</i> Bride,<lb/>
full of love, and sees still better,<lb/>
when <i>Eolus’</i> troops do not occupy <lb/>
the air with thick dark clouds,<lb/>
preventing her from entry.<lb/>

9. Many times one sees Colors and Images<lb/>
in the clouds, which multiply <lb/>
or diminish in various ways,<lb/>
depending on whether the material of fire<lb/>
or the thickness of the clouds dominate them.<lb/>
Now we still have to turn our subject<lb/>
to a reflection in the clouds,<lb/>
wondrous for all people to see.<lb/>

10. Directly opposite the Sun,<lb/>
more often in the Autumn, when the days are short,<lb/>
there is displayed a half Ring, <lb/>
or a semicircle, large and broadly dissolved,<lb/>
as the Sun begins to sink or set,<lb/>
then its height reaches its highest;<lb/>
but lest I deprive you of its name,<lb/>
I mean the many-hued Rainbow.<lb/>
