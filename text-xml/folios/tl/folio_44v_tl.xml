As in the lap of his <i>Moses</i>,<lb/>
but Titian, great, of fame–<lb/>
his painting is in all ways full of life,<lb/>
not only in nudes, but also<lb/>
in splendid Fabrics with well-conceived folds,<lb/>
as can also see in his woodcuts.<lb/>

26. Reader, I would like to show you <lb/>
many more Italians, well versed in their art:<lb/>
<i>Del</i> <i>Sarto</i>, <i>Tintoretto</i>, <i>Veronese</i>,<lb/>
the two <i>Zuccari</i>, and <i>Baroccio</i>.<lb/>
These earn the crown for painting Fabrics<lb/>
with grace and elegance. Yet succeeding well<lb/>
with the beauty of Fabric lies always <lb/>
in finely conceived folds.<lb/>

27. But in offering you an Example from <lb/>
Drapery of the Ancients, I do not wish <lb/>
to waste words, for you should avoid them <lb/>
in favor of these times. Indeed, they look like <lb/>
nothing but wet linen, and hang like ropes. <lb/>
In consequence, such Statues would require<lb/>
very different drapery to be remarkable.<lb/>
The poor quality has astonished many.<lb/>
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Among the Ancients there is little or no good fabric.</ab>

28. I never saw Ancient Drapery in Rome<lb/>
 (if my limited memory does not deceive me)<lb/>
that had any worth, except for some floating <lb/>
on bronze Statues (unless I lack in judgment); <lb/>
these resembled Goddesses, <lb/>
whose Ancient Draperies might well <lb/>
win  the prize. I saw these <lb/>
in the new <i>Farnese</i> Palace, above the gallery.<lb/>

29. In the same Palace there is also a <i>Flora</i>;<lb/>
her sculpted drapery is far from ugly.<lb/>
But since I am discussing floating draperies:<lb/>
If it is set indoors, the drape floats fully<lb/>
behind the walking or running Figure;<lb/>
but if it is outside, one must make a part<lb/>
float in the direction of the wind, <lb/>
that blows strongly or gently, from in front or behind.<lb/>

30. The mind must be employed in these works<lb/>
to show a blast of wind pressing<lb/>
these thin fabrics or pieces of silk against the body,<lb/>
so that we can see, naturally, (if you succeed)<lb/>
the knees, torso and legs of the nude. <lb/>
Here we need the friendship of the <i>Graces</i>,<lb/>
