<ab>lest he receive the punishment of <i>Arachne</i> <lb/>

Thus as you make your name in art, <lb/>
Guard against complacency and ambition.<lb/>

<ab>57. Even if you ran along Art’s course like a Hart,<lb/>
and others crawled gently like Snails, <lb/>
and if alone were assured of the Prize,<lb/>
seeing few or one alongside you <lb/>
but the many following despondently behind– <lb/>
do not then be so thoughtless <lb/>
as to boast about the gifts of God, <lb/>
like Pages who sit upon their Lord’s Horses.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>

Whoever is inclined to Art should not boast of his gift.

<ab>58.  Do not be proud or haughty about what is lent to you<lb/>
but humbly thank the one who procures it for you<lb/>
for your needs, all your life, <lb/>
since it is only to earn your living:<lb/>
Art or Artist, all must perish,<lb/>
however lively, however witty, pulled down<lb/>
by the bridle of Death, who distinguishes nothing,<lb/>
to the depths of his dark prison.<lb/>
</ab>

One should thank God for His gifts.

<ab>59. Although Art is not, like Wealth, <lb/>
subject to the course of Fortune, <lb/>
do not be too conceited about it,<lb/>
for nothing lasts in this earthly vale of tears. <lb/>
Your sight, now clear, may be obscured by darkness, <lb/>
and something may afflict your Body,<lb/>
which will suffer from head to toe; <lb/>
then the practice of Art is worth nothing.<lb/>

<ab>60. So I advise, however rich you become from Art, <lb/>
always stay humble and down-to-earth,<lb/>
and do not do what people foolishly do: <lb/>
If they have recently gained fleeting lucre<lb/>
from some business or other,<lb/>
there is often very little chance <lb/>
they will deign to be interested <lb/>
in poor acquaintances, friends or relatives.<lb/>

<ab>61. Doing your honorable best is nothing to be scorned.<sup><comment>7 Literally, “sneezed at.”</comment></sup><lb/>
In order not to stay stuck in the mud <lb/>
you should work hard at the proper exercise of the hand<lb/>
from youth onward, and not be discouraged.<lb/>
In order not to be a bungler all your life, <lb/>
avoid the playful libertine <i>Cupid</i>, <lb/>
the desire for lovemaking, whose purpose<lb/>
is to keep Youth from the path to virtue.<lb/>
