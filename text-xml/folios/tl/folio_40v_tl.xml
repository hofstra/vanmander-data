But when they caught sight of <i>Apelles’</i> work,<lb/>
They began to snort and bridle.<lb/>
Such a judgment, from innocent Animals,<lb/>
Has afterwards been handed down more. <lb/>

26. This competition of our Forebears<lb/>
makes us notice how seriously they studied Art, <lb/>
and attesting to this are works still left over,<lb/>
for example in <i>Venice</i>, over the Church portal,<lb/>
four copper Horses, outstandingly beautiful.<lb/>
And in <i>Rome</i>, displayed on the Capitoline,<lb/>
a cast Horse surpassing Nature,<lb/>
and life itself, but no Art is excluded.<lb/>

27. Near there are the Horses of Monte Cavallo<lb/>
by <i>Praxiteles</i> and <i>Phidias’</i>  hands.<lb/>
From all these do not stray<lb/>
In knowledge about beauty, one shall derive<lb/>
A good design and proper understanding.<lb/>
Because I know of no place or Country<lb/>
in the World which will better teach us <lb/>
the finest and best from real life.<lb/>

28. There is no doubt that the ancients<lb/>
made use of <i>ecorchés</i>, and also those of Animals, <lb/>
which they examined in full.<lb/>
Now I wish to acquaint you, O happy spirits,<lb/>
with all the qualities of other Animals,<lb/>
and will now engage in describing<lb/>
the largest of the cattle, <lb/>
such as Bulls, Oxen and Cows.<lb/>

29.  Although Heifers, Cows, Oxen and Bulls<lb/>
greatly resemble one another, and while<lb/>
they surely possess similar features,<lb/>
the eyes of Bulls are not so kindly;<lb/>
their faces are far more terrifying,<lb/>
and their ears have thicker hair<lb/>
than those of Oxen, and in the main<lb/>
their horns are thinner and smaller.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Bulls’ horns are much smaller than those of Oxen.</ab>

30.  The <i>Mantuan</i>, in his book instructing farmers,<lb/>
found one Cow’s shape especially good<lb/>
for procreation. Likewise <lb/>
for a Bull is a terrifying head;<lb/>
pointing horns and refusing to pull the plow;<lb/>
a hide was marked with white spots;<lb/>
a huge neck, great feet and limbs,<lb/>
and a long tail touching the Ground below.<lb/>
