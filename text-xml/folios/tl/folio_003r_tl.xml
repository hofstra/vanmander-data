<ab>as we read of Ulysses ' companions. <lb/>
But how much worse is fighting, <lb/>
and how very common it is, <lb/>
to arouse the praise of the foolish world, <lb/>
which in this regard calls the volatile ones valiant heroes<lb/>
and, astonishingly, can blame the gentle ones.<lb/>

 </ab>

<ab>22. Nevertheless (according to the words of the Wise)<lb/>
he who fully masters his own heart<lb/>
is much stronger and more praiseworthy than one who kills another. <lb/>
The word “murderer” makes everyone shudder;<lb/>
the name “thief” is in many shameful ways distasteful.<lb/>
To defend the thief I appeal to views that prevail in the law:<lb/>
the thief can return what is stolen, <lb/>
but the murderer cannot wake the dead to life.<lb/>

<ab>23. Thus drunkenness, with all its evil fruits<lb/>
which would be too long and useless to relate,<lb/>
O curious minds, you must flee without regret,<lb/>
so that these false rumors about Artists<lb/>
like "a painter is a lunatic" <lb/>
can sink to the bottom of the Styx,<lb/>
and the popular proverb: "the more one is a painter, the more one is wild"<lb/>
can change to "the more one is a painter, the more one is serene."<lb/>

<ab>

That young Painters must avoid drunkenness. The proverb "the more one is a painter, the more one is wild" must go.

<ab>24. However, it seems that some artists think<lb/>
That art is enriched when the public says, "it is a pity<lb/>
that this fine Mind, aside from his studies, <lb/>
is such a drunken, wild, and brutal<lb/>
hothead and turns angry so easily.”<lb/>
Yet this will cool many an ardent art-lover, <lb/>
and make some admirers less eager <lb/>
to teach their children the rules of art.<lb/>

<ab>25. Do not be discouraged, noble young painters,<lb/>
that some vines put forth bad fruit; <lb/>
to our sorrow, we hear tell<lb/>
that the greatest Artists are the least virtuous,<lb/>
for sometimes we can thank a single person<lb/>
for tarnishing an entire tribe,<lb/>
when he defies the noble Nature <lb/>
of the quiet, pure study of Painting.<lb/>

False view that the greatest artists are the greatest scoundrels: since it is contrary to the nature of the art of painting

<ab>26. He is not worthy of being considered an "artist" <lb/>
who wastes Her noble spirit, <lb/>
like a savage, uncivilized, rude barbarian; <lb/>
for the reputation of Painters <lb/>
has always been singled out by Prators, <lb/>
Senators, Philosophers, Poets, <lb/>
Princes, and highly-placed Monarchs.<lb/>
 </ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>
Those who lead an unruly life are not worthy of the name of artist. <lb/>
Painters have always been beloved by princes and scholars.
