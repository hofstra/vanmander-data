44. Here he placed some characters<lb/>
who look around or stroll for entertainment;<lb/>
others, to pass the time,<lb/>
enjoyed themselves on the water.<lb/>
On dry land, he placed laden wagons <lb/>
and set Donkeys in the fields and paths<lb/>
along with the Houses and Farms,<lb/>
and other elements of country work.<lb/>

by the people of the time<lb/>
was one in which he painted in particular<lb/>
a marshy valley with some Homesteads,<lb/>
where the roads were muddy, <lb/>
difficult to walk on without slipping.<lb/>
His portrayal of this was fine to look at;<lb/>
and he also showed women slipping and falling.<lb/>

trembling for fear of falling down,<lb/>
and others, bent and sloping,<lb/>
as if carrying a heavy weight<lb/>
on their heads or shoulders. Yes, to be brief at last:<lb/>
he knew how to sow everywhere in his works<lb/>
ten thousand amusing elements.<lb/>
Now I let you too imagine as many.<lb/>

is depicting various animals well.<lb/>
We should not linger too long<lb/>
On other matters without trying<lb/>
To see if we cannot at first give life to<lb/>
this rare part of art. We should not be like<lb/>
<i>Dionisius</i>, who did not wish this,<lb/>
And would only make Images of Men.<lb/>
