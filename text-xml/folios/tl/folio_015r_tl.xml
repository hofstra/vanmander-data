while Youths, who wish to banish melancholy,<lb/>
must be alert, with relaxed limbs,<lb/>
wholly free and loose. Now, the pose <lb/>
of old men: they should hold fast to something<lb/>
with their hands to support their weak bodies,<lb/>
with weary legs tending to fold.<lb/>

40. In sum, all figures should be realized<lb/>
according to a person’s strength and spirit,<lb/>
as well as actions, as is well understood:<lb/>
for a fighter will exert himself differently<lb/>
in pose and movement, more fiercely, <lb/>
than a Philosopher, who in his gestures<lb/>
appears to be disputing profound matters;<lb/>
one must do one’s beset to distinguish them.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
Differences between actions, according to the natures and circumstances of the people.

41. This man must appear, with one finger on another finger,<lb/>
to be diligently making his argument clear.<lb/>
Now there are many things which need no less<lb/>
Art to depict well, such as a singer,<lb/>
Or the difference between laughing and crying,<lb/>
Frightened, melancholy, proud, and regretful,<lb/>
But these and similar subjects<lb/>
You will find in expressions of the Passions.<lb/>

1. All things exist in a right and proper <lb/>
arrangement or composition: <lb/>
God’s creatures above and below,<lb/>
kingdoms, countries, free states, <lb/>
households, and various practices<lb/>
which ingenious people bring into being;<lb/>
one also sees ordering among dumb animals,<lb/>
such as useful bees and industrious ants.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>Arrangement is necessary in everything; it is also practiced among the animals.</ab>

2. For painters, too, composition is<lb/>
indispensable, for here is where the excellence <lb/>
and power of the arts lie, bound together,<lb/>
along with perfection, spirit, intelligence <lb/>
and understanding, attentiveness, experience in all things;<lb/>
therefore there are so few people gifted in<lb/>
composition who are competent, <lb/>
that we hear them praised for surpassing others in fame.<lb/>

let us turn our attention to Composition<lb/>
in our principal composition,<lb/>
whether outdoors, in a house or a room,<lb/>
