looked so severe because of his eyebrows<lb/>
that no-one would come speak to him<lb/>
easily and without flinching, <lb/> 
unless they had known him already.<lb/>
When the people of Athens laughed<lb/>
at his eyebrows, (he said) “They offend no one, <lb/>
but such empty laughter costs this City many tears.”<lb/>

his own inclinations (like a Philosopher),<lb/>

the cheeks are narrower; <lb/>
