68. This Woman’s soul seemed to submit<lb/>
to worry and fear that her little one, <lb/>
finding her milk, would suck her blood<lb/>
along with the dead milk. Thus, by all accounts,<lb/>
this artful Picture was so famous<lb/>
that no less than the great <i>Alexander</i>,<lb/> 
because it gave him such delight,<lb/>
had it carried to his native City of <i>Pellas</i>.<lb/>

69. This face may well have had the mouth<lb/>
open on one side, just as we have described<lb/>
a demeanor pertaining to sorrow:<lb/>
the forehead’s wrinkles pressing against each other,<lb/>
the eyebrows raised unevenly,<lb/>
the flesh color fading with approaching death,<lb/>
a blush of pale purple on lip and cheek,<lb/>
staring fixedly at the child with grieving eyes.<lb/>

one must descend into deeper caves,<lb/>
far from here, somewhere near the <i>Cimmerians</i>, <lb/>
where the Father of <i>Morpheus</i> has his empire,<lb/>

Then I greatly hope that this will kindle <lb/>
many more spirits, and increase the desire<lb/>
to better attend to the Emotions.<lb/>

use them more than they know themselves;<lb/>
indeed, being perfect in one skill, they are perfect in all.<lb/>
Thus their works shall be far from belittled  <lb/>

and that in painting the Emotions<lb/>
no other Painter came before him;<lb/>
but this remark is based on ignorance, or opinion,<lb/>
and is contrary to Pliny.<lb/>
