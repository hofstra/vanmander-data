10. Color, in nature, has marvelous powers. <lb/>
One can find Examples in the case of<lb/>
Pregnant Women, whose thoughts<lb/>
imagined something such that they give birth to a child<lb/>
who has this color: black, or something else. <lb/>
we know this, and see it happen<lb/>
that children’s bodies have birthmarks<lb/>
of the same sort that frightened their mothers.<lb/>

11. Similarly, when they are at times dreadfully <lb/>
frightened by sudden profuse bleeding, <lb/>
they give their children blood-colored birthmarks, <lb/>
or abundant spots in another color;<lb/>
or when some fruits or flowers<lb/>
strike them in the face or elsewhere<lb/>
at the beginning of their pregnancy,<lb/>
if they do not wipe them off at once.<lb/>

12. Thus is the power of Color manifested.<lb/>
 In this regard, we can draw on the story <lb/>
of <i>Jacob</i> who lived in Laban, in the East.<lb/>
because the effect of the colors came to him <lb/>
when he laid down speckled sticks in front of his herd<lb/>
in the rutting season, so that he acquired<lb/>
goats, sheep, donkeys and other animals<lb/>
with mottled and multicolored coats.<lb/>

13.  The capacity of colors is evident<lb/>
in many ways among Birds and Beasts.<lb/>
It gives them a noble and splendid ornament,<lb/>
such as Tigers, Leopards and Panthers<lb/>
who, among the jungle quadrupeds, without exception, <lb/>
are pursued for their beautiful markings, <lb/>
or for their sweet musk,<lb/>
although they have to pay for it with their lives.<lb/>

14. It would be a pleasure [to see] the colors<lb/>
of the bird Phoenix, as Pliny describes;<lb/>
In the same way one sees the Peacock parade,<lb/>
making a wheel of its joyous colors<lb/>
And turning it toward the Sunshine.<lb/>
How beautiful is the splendor of the Parrot,<lb/>
and the Pigeons, whose necks shine like gold,<lb/>
and are called <i>Columba</i> in Latin.<lb/>

our present discourse too long.<lb/>
Yet the heart rises from melancholy thoughts<lb/>
