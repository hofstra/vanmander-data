all converge and narrow back into the distance, <lb/>
from both sides, liked tiled floors. <lb/>
Never tire of observing this,<lb/>
because it gives more depth to your backgrounds.<lb/>

9. Pay attention to foreshortening and diminishing,<lb/>
as one sees in life; I say to you,<lb/>
it is not only architecture that requires precise rules.<lb/>
You still need to know how to place <lb/>
your eye or point correctly on the Horizon,<lb/>
that is, on the uppermost line of the water,<lb/>
All that is below is seen above,<lb/>
And the rest can be seen shifted from below.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>On the need to understand foreshortening.</ab>
<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>The Horizon is where the Sky and water part, or sometimes where the sky and ground part.</ab>

10. As for the background, it can never be too faint,<lb/>
Not as pale in the depth below as it is higher up.<lb/>
considering the thickening of the Air, dense with blue,<lb/>
which come between our gaze and the distance,<lb/>
obscuring our attempts at keen understanding. <lb/>
On occasion, here and there, <lb/>
as if the Sun were shining through the clouds,<lb/>
one can bring out Cities and Mountains. <lb/>

11. Next to this one should also darken,<lb/>
sometimes completely, sometimes half, the Cities<lb/>
shadowed by clouds, and still make sure not to miss<lb/>
the water mirroring the colors in the sky. <lb/>
Following the old custom, divide the sky in two,<lb/>
it is very good sometimes to let it gently melt at the bottom,<lb/> 
as well as, sometimes, the glow of the sun.<lb/>

12. The exceptions are periods of harsh winds <lb/>
when the Sea is agitated and streams become fountains.<lb/>
I am sometimes led to marvel<lb/>
At how full of thunder and lightning<lb/>
Apelles’ colors are, being so few. <lb/>
Now they are numerous and pure,<lb/>
Suitable for depicting such unusual things.<lb/>
Why does the desire to imitate them not impel us too?<lb/>
</ab>

<margin>right-middle</margin>Apelles painted with a mere four colors, as Pliny says, and created lightning, thunder and other such things; we, with so many more colors, must also wish to pursue nature in its entirety.</ab>

13. On occasion, paint the water’s raging surface,<lb/>
Stirred by the messenger of <i>Eolus</i>;<lb/>
create black thunderstorms, threatening and monstrous,<lb/>
and crooked bolts of lightning, through the wild tempest<lb/>
in the blackened sky, arriving in a flood<lb/>
from the hand of the highest of the Gods,<lb/>
so that all mortal Soul-bearing creatures<lb/>
appear driven to fear from such things.<lb/>

14. One should also attempt with colors<lb/>
to make snow, hail, and cloudburst,<lb/>
sleet, frost, and gloomy, smothering mist.<lb/>
