by such strange means,<lb/> 
with various sundry elaborations,<lb/> 
that one guesses poorly at the meaning<lb/>

Here I offer an example,<lb/> 
Which was recounted by the poet Iacobo,<lb/> 
A poet from the City named after one of the Sirens.<lb/>

and some of the shepherds relieving<lb/> 
the stiff udders swollen with milk<lb/> 
and others shearing the curly fleeces. <lb/>

others, while singing, appeared to wish <lb/> 
to imitate the sound with their voices.<lb/>

quite naked, half-hidden by a chestnut bush.<lb/>

49. These were looking at a ram before them<lb/> 
and laughing together joyfully, <lb/>

to graze on the green grass <lb/> 
and pleasant pastures at his feet.<lb/>
