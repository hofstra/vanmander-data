12. For it seems that during the rising<lb/>
or setting of the Sun, one sometimes sees<lb/>
different Suns appear; however, to prove<lb/>
that there are many Suns is not to be praised,<lb/>
but that there are many Reflections.<lb/>
Because one would not see such a spectacle<lb/>
in an unobstructed clear sky,<lb/>
unless it were an especially great miracle.<lb/>

13. Further, one will not see the Rainbow<lb/>
when the Sky is covered with clouds,<lb/>
and so here one should trust <i>Pliny</i>:<lb/>
it would be a hollow cloud, as if carved out,<lb/>
which would receive the Sun’s reflection.<lb/>
But with regard to the round shape<lb/>
I could not attribute it to the cloud<lb/>
but rather to the roundness of the Sun.<lb/>

14. The Rainbow, as <i>Pliny</i> attested,<lb/>
can be seen every day in the sky above<lb/>
<i>Lacus</i> <i>Velinus</i>, in the Principality of Spoleto,<lb/>
what we now call (as I understand)<lb/>
the Lake of <i>Piede</i> <i>Lupi</i>. If one wishes to believe it,<lb/>
at a certain distance the River <i>Negra</i><lb/>
rushes with great clamor,<lb/>
from very high mountains into the deep valleys. <lb/>

15. This River, taking its source<lb/>
from this Lake that provides its waters,<lb/>
falls from the rocks at <i>Terni</i>, <lb/>
between <i>Venice</i> and <i>Rome</i>; the roar it makes<lb/>
through the hollow stones is terrifying.<lb/>
Even with loud shouts, one can scarcely<lb/>
exchange words with another,<lb/>
except by putting one’s mouth to another’s ear.<lb/>

16. Great fog or mist is rising all the time<lb/>
from this powerful Waterfall,<lb/>
where, through the Lord’s work<lb/>
one can observe a natural Rainbow every day,<lb/>
if the Sun casts its light from any side.<lb/>
I will attest that I have seen it,<lb/>
because walking sometimes from Terni,<lb/>
I have waited there for part of this short distance.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>The Rainbow can be seen in a mist, which is produced by the waterfall at Terni. </ab>
