12. Fresco is not used here, unlike<lb/>
what <i>Michelangelo</i> attributes to women,<lb/>
since here in Holland, if outdoors, <lb/>
it would hold up poorly against the harsh <lb/>
Air, Wind, Snow, Hail, and Rain<lb/>
driven by <i>Boreas</i>.  Even inside, it cannot <lb/>
endure or perhaps stay beautiful for very long<lb/>
because of the great humidity of these walls.<lb/>

13. Furthermore the Lime that is burned<lb/>
from Seashells is of no use, for<lb/>
it oozes and makes musty spots.<lb/>
One should use limestone from other places<lb/>
such as Tournai, or elsewhere, <lb/>
which better resists bad storms and frost,<lb/>
When used for painting, it is thick<lb/>
and dries stiffly without mold<lb/>

14. But passing over this: making cartoons<lb/>
the same size as your work<lb/>
is useful and practical if they are boldly<lb/>
and clearly designed. They will appease<lb/>
your work if you hang them <lb/>
before you, lest you wander on unfamiliar paths<lb/>
or lose sight of what is essential.<lb/>
Darken and brighten everything, following the design.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>The Cartoon is an advantage</ab>

15. Indeed, with the ground color darkened and brightened,<lb/>
your cartoon must assume the character of a painting,<lb/>
so that there is not the slightest imperfection in  <lb/>
standing out, shadowing, relief, rounding,<lb/>
grace, flow, contrast, perspective:<lb/>
and in your work, you must take care<lb/>
not to tire easily, but ceaselessly long <lb/>
to achieve, through effort, the greatest soundness.<lb/>
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Cartoons must also have their highlights.</ab>

16. Our modern Predecessors worked on<lb/>
their panels with white primer, more than we do;<lb/>
and polished them as smoothly as they wished.<lb/>
They also used cartoons, which they placed<lb/>
on this even white layer, and laid down<lb/>
with some dark/releasing substance rubbed on the back,<lb/>
there they neatly retraced the drawing<lb/>
with black chalks, or graphite.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>The moderns thickly whitened their panels, also using cartoons. </ab>

17. But the most effective was this: some took<lb/>
black charcoal, delicately rubbed it with water, then dried it,<lb/>
and carefully darkened their subjects as appropriate.<lb/>
Then they neatly laid down a thin primer on top, <lb/>
allowing one to see everything through it,<lb/>
arranged with great forethought. <lb/>
