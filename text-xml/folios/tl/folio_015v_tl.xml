wherever we have to place our figures, <lb/> 
and do this by certain rules and laws<lb/> 
according to the demands of<lb/> 
the History we are planning.<lb/>

4. For one image or figureâ€™s composition<lb/> 
is of many parts in a body,<lb/> 
all contained in a surface<lb/> 
but the History has (according to its nature)<lb/> 
joined together images or figures<lb/> 
in keeping with its composition;<lb/> 
now observe, in order to place them,<lb/> 
that there are seven motions of movement.<lb/> 
</ab>
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin><i>Superficium</i> is the perimeter of the History or composition.</ab>
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>On the seven <i>Motus</i> or movements, maintained in the composition.</ab>

5. First, upwards in an upright position,<lb/>  
then under and downwards, to the right side<lb/> 
and to the left, receding or going away from us, <lb/> 
then coming the other way, and also around<lb/> 
so that the space is encompassed in a circle. But at all times<lb/> 
one must conform to the enclosure, and keep<lb/> 
the figures from carrying the frame<lb/> 
or looking as if they are stuffed in boxes<lb/> 
</ab>

6. Place the people somewhat loosely, for an agreeable effect.<lb/> 
Do not let your imagination run so wild <lb/> 
and make things so large<lb/> 
that hands and feet run into the frame,<lb/> 
or lie uncomfortably cramped,<lb/> 
so that they are constrained by the space.<lb/> 
Erase and adjust, using the gifts of Art.<lb/> 
Indeed, you are free; do not enslave your figures.<lb/> 
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>One should not make the figures too large, or force them into a small space.</ab>

7.  Always keep freely within the boundary,<lb/> 
and keep the ground from being too overloaded:<lb/> 
but as you set to work on your invention, <lb/> 
first with careful attention<lb/> 
to your intention, fully consider your meaning<lb/> 
with reading, re-reading; there is no harm in <lb/> 
firmly impressing on your memory<lb/> 
the proper nature of the history. <lb/> 
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Being loose in composition.</ab>
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>First read or study [the subject] you wish to paint.</ab>

8. First, paint your imagination<lb/> 
with a lively sensitive pieces,<lb/> 
to express your material with pleasing grace<lb/> 
(as good Orators do with their speech)<lb/> 
beautifully, with art and skill.<lb/> 
And in order to better succeed,<lb/> 
You should make some sketches of it,<lb/> 
As many as you need to achieve your power.<lb/> 
</ab>	

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Depict everything with grace. </ab>
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>First make sketches.</ab>

9. Let your imagination flow, so that art will bloom.<lb/> 
Like the Italians, you should <lb/> 
draw cartoons from your sketches<lb/>
