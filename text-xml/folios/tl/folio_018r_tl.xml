34. Yet some Histories in particular <lb/> 
ought to be simpler than others,<lb/> 
still others are more skillfully composed:<lb/> 
one should work like a merchant <lb/> 
who artfully displays his goods <lb/> 
on high shelves, at the sides and below;<lb/>

as is seen in the manner of the world,<lb/> 
and to create the most pleasing and diverting<lb/> 
presentation; and this shall not do badly.<lb/>
