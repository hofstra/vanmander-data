by the shoulders. Then one saw several,<lb/> 
who already noticed them coming <lb/> 
and their eager intentions, fleeing into the forest<lb/> 
without fear of twigs or brambles.<lb/>

51. The swiftest of these one saw climbing up <lb/> 
in a maple tree, holding in her hands<lb/> 
a long bough she had gathered up<lb/> 
and defended/defending herself with it; the others,<lb/> 
having no confidence in earthly protection,<lb/> 
instead leapt into a river to flee the shame,<lb/> 
and one saw their white bodies<lb/> 
floating in the transparent flowing water.<lb/>

52. As their rescue was now apparent,<lb/> 
since they were over the water on the opposite bank,<lb/> 
they sat down, puffing and panting with the effort,<lb/> 
to  dry their wet hair.  And it appeared that they <lb/> 
all together, with words and gestures, <lb/> 
mockingly accused their pursuers, without stopping,<lb/> 
for they had been unable to get hold of them.<lb/>

53. In a bay along the water, one saw <lb/> 
the golden-haired Apollo sitting and leaning<lb/> 
against the trunk of a wild olive tree. At that moment<lb/> 
he could be seen as a shepherd <lb/> 
guarding the herd of <i>Admetus</i>, <lb/> 
and appeared to be turning his serious gaze<lb/> 
on two powerful Bulls, who greeted one another<lb/> 
with their horns and violently came together,<lb/>

(wearing a goatskin under his left shoulder,<lb/> 
following the shepherdsâ€™ style) <lb/> 
had in the meantime stolen his cows:<lb/> 
There too stood <i>Battus</i>, who, being displeased,<lb/> 
openly revealed this theft and<lb/> 
turned to stone, in such a manner<lb/> 
that he still seemed to be pointing his finger.<lb/>

55. On a large rock, somewhat lower,<lb/> 
sat <i>Mercury</i> with his cheeks puffed out<lb/> 
playing on a reed pipe; with a devious air<lb/> 
and flashing eyes, looking at the spot next to him<lb/> 
where a white heifer stood,<lb/> 
and it seemed that he was pondering<lb/> 
with malice how he might best swindle<lb/> 
the many-eyed <i>Argus</i> out of it. <lb/>
