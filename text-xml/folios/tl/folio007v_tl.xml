from such alloys will sound good enough <lb/>
to gladden your Parents and friends. <lb/>
And when you smarten yourself up nicely and respectably,<lb/>
then your arrival will be unwelcome to none; <lb/>
People will welcome and greet you. <lb/>
Then off with the shoes, traveling is over; <lb/>
one will quickly be bound to one’s Sweetheart. <lb/>

75. Finally, remember not to return <lb/>
without having profited from going away:<lb/>
bring back from <i>Rome</i> the correct manner of drawing, <lb/>
and good painting from the city of <i>Venice</i>, <lb/>
which I had to pass by for lack of time.<lb/>
For I too have travelled some paths, <lb/>
which (now I’ll stop my warnings)<lb/>
I shall briefly recount to you.<lb/>

76. Because of <i>Pictura</i> I arrived there, <lb/>
where with desire, the balm of sorrow,<lb/>
I climbed over the terrifyingly high,<lb/>
snow-covered <i>Alps</i> in <i>Helvetia</i>, <lb/>
and also over the hostile <i>Apennines</i>, <lb/>
in whose mist and dark, bad weather <lb/>
the great general <i>Hannibal</i> <lb/>
could not succeed in crossing<lb/>
</ab>

77.  I went so far that I saw, and lived in,<lb/>
the longed-for City which was (as one may read)<lb/>
begun by two Foster children of a She-wolf <lb/>
as a small town on the <i>Palatine</i> Hill,<lb/>
and whose fame has spread throughout the World.<lb/>
Ruined buildings educated me <lb/>
And asserted, with a solid argument,<lb/>
how splendid Rome was in antiquity.<lb/>

78.  Sometimes I traveled outside the city <lb/>
with the Italians to practice Art.<lb/> 
There I saw <i>Cicero's Villa Tusculana</i>, <lb/>
the old country of <i>Latium</i> and <i>Alba Longa</i>. <lb/>
Also <i>Monte Circeo</i>, the lofty height <lb/>
where <i>Ulysses</i>' men were driven into the Pigsty<lb/>
(according to the Poets’ verses) <lb/>
and the <i>Via Appia</i>, with still more monuments.<lb/>

79. I have urged myself to see, for the sake of Art,<lb/>
Various Waters, worthy of mention; <lb/>
I have travelled, with uncommon discomfort,<lb/>
over the salt waves of the <i>Tyrrhenian</i> sea.<lb/> 
I also saw the wine-rich <i>Tiber</i>, <lb/>
a troubled torrent, and the <i>Po</i>, proud <lb/>
to have won a noble reputation<lb/>
through an unlucky Charioteer of the Sun.<lb/>
