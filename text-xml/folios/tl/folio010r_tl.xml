<ab>19. It is absolutely necessary to comprehend<lb/> 
the entirety of the nude figure, in every aspect,<lb/>
though in so doing, one must make sure<lb/>
not to depict the Muscles or Sinews <lb/>
too starkly; otherwise our Figures will seem<lb/>
to waste away from scrawniness.<lb/>
One should not thoughtlessly neglect<lb/>
the plump and smooth softness of a living body. </ab>


<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>Muscles must be understood, but little in movement, unless appropriate.</ab>

<ab>20. You can stump–that is, spread chalk with a cotton swab–<lb/>
or gently work it into a fine grain<lb/>
without hatching, or rub it with something.<lb/>
If you want to improve your art of hatching,<lb/>
let your lines increase from thin to heavy,<lb/>
that is, draw them from the top down,<lb/>
taking care to portray the muscles or other things<lb/>
as if all the <i>Graces</i> are there at play.<sup><comment>18 That is, beautifully. The Graces (<i>Gratien</i>)
refers to three minor goddesses of Greek mythology known as the <i>charites</i> or graces,
named Aglaea ("Splendor"), Euphrosyne ("Mirth"), and Thalia ("Good Cheer") representing various aspects of
inspiration, creativity and pleasure. They are traditionally depicted as three standing female nudes, embracing or with
arms linked, often with the center figure facing the opposite direction</comment></sup></ab>

<ab>21. Pastels are made with various pigments<lb/>
mixed with Glue which is half-spoiled.<sup><comment>19 VM’s word is <i>lijm</i></comment></sup><lb/>
With these one can mimic the shapes of nature;<lb/>
indeed, one can represent color in all figures<lb/>
whether youthful or dead.<lb/>
This will bring you honor,<lb/>
because the art of drawing is the father of painting:<lb/>
No two things can be closer together.</ab>

<ab>22. In sum, the art of Drawing can be useful<lb/>
to all estates, whether young or old,<lb/>
indeed, princes, generals and soldiers,<lb/>
whether to speak of art with knowledge in these matters<lb/>
or to indicate fortifications and towns. <lb/>
Therefore the noble art of drawing is to be praised,<lb/>
from which we will continue to Proportion.</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>The art of drawing is useful for princes, generals and soldiers for indicating cities and fortifications;

1. Proportion, or pure regularity, <lb/>
is (as <i>Plutarch</i> tells us in this respect)<lb/>
a beautiful, noble ornament in nature.<sup><comment>1 VM is probably referring to Plutarch’s “De Anima procreation e Timaeo”, where, 
summarizing Plato, he writes that God did not create matter but shape it: “disposed, digested, and embellished the confused mass. 
so that he brought to perfection a most absolute and glorious creature.”

This <i>Proportion</i>, in architecture or figures,<lb/>
<i>Vitruvius</i> (always artful by nature) calls <lb/>
a constant agreement in the relation of the limbs <lb/>
or parts of the entire building, <lb/>
if properly designed according to the rules of art.<sup><comment>2 Vitruvius <i>De Archtitectura</i>i> III, I: 
“Proportion is a due adjustment of the size of the different parts to each other and to the whole; on this proper adjustment symmetry depends.” 
<i>Proportio est ratae partis membrorum in omni opera, totiusque commodulatio, ex qua ratio efficitur symmetrarium.</i>
