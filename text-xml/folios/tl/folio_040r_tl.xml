he threw the sponge at it <lb/>
(the one with which he was painting)<lb/>
and the result pleased him very much. <lb/>

20. Indeed, the spatter from the sponge stayed<lb/>
hanging from his Horse’s mouth, just like actual foam; <lb/>
thus from this angry gesture, he realized <lb/>
his intention in his work.  While ascribed to luck, <lb/>
and not to his Art, it is the same.<lb/>
In sum, one discovers here with what devotion<lb/>
and fervor the ancients sought <lb/>
how best to depict all details.<lb/>

21. In Rome in the hall of <i>Constantine</i>,<lb/>
that foam is depicted properly.<lb/>
Protogenes, according to <i>Pliny’s</i> account,<lb/>
could not paint the foam on a Dog<lb/>
as he intended, and fared so poorly<lb/>
painting weak forms that he attacked his work<lb/>
with a sponge–the same as we saw above–<lb/>
and it looked so fine that all were compelled to praise it.<lb/>

22. For first this foam did not look natural,<lb/>
says <i>Pliny</i>, and was quite different<lb/>
from its true appearance in life; but seemed<lb/>
diligently painted, for taking great pains, he wished<lb/>
to show the foam flowing from the mouth.<lb/>
<i>Nealcas</i> also painted a young man leading it,<lb/>
or holding and stroking it;<lb/>
there too, his sponge worked miracles.<lb/>

23.Thus we might also, as appropriate, study<lb/>
the foam of horses, with busy perseverance.<lb/>
How something is made, with thumbs, <lb/>
or a sponge, or anything else uncommon,<lb/>
whatever looks good, is good; this I find worthy.<lb/>
But one can well grasp that antique artists<lb/>
put great effort into painting horses well,<lb/>
because there was praise to be won.<lb/>

24. <i>Apelles</i>, the Chief painter of Antiquity,<lb/>
with more other Painters of his time,<lb/>
had a competition among themselves:<lb/>
but he, fearing that People would <lb/>
judge his work badly out of envy,<lb/>
and favor the other side,<lb/>
to the advantage of his rivals,<lb/>
he much preferred the judgment of Animals.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>In earlier times, one worked very hard painting Horses, for there was Praise to be earned.</ab>

25.  So he led real Horses to the group<lb/>
of Steeds he had painted. But was there <lb/>
a flaw? They walked by like muzzled Oxen, <lb/>
without making any noise.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>Apelles coveted the judgment of Animals: Horses snorted at his painted Horses.</ab>
