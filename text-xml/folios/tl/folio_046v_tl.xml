1. If drawing, in a manner of speaking,<lb/>
is compared to the Body<lb/>
with its different members, <lb/>
then it is not inappropriate to compare <lb/>
painting to the Spirit, or the Soul.<lb/>
For through colors, the dead strokes<lb/>
of drawing begin to stir and live<lb/>
and are truly awakened.<lb/>

2. Indeed, drawing is like the Clay statue<lb/>
made by <i>Prometheus</i>, which displeased <lb/>
<i>Minerva</i>, Goddess of the Arts.<lb/>
But painting is like the Celestial fire he stole<lb/>
he stole, and with which–to his own destruction–<lb/>
he endowed his work with movement,<lb/>
and in time it became <i>Pandora</i>,<lb/>
the abundance of all good things.<lb/>

that Poets, when singing, to beguile the ear,<lb/>
marry their verses and their poems to the lyre <lb/>
or another instrument, we must do<lb/>
likewise to gratify the sight,<lb/>
uniting Drawing and Painting<lb/>
just as strings are joined to voices.<lb/>

4. I would not presume to say with praise or disdain<lb/>
that some, who are well-practiced, experienced <lb/>
of a firm hand, full of accomplishment, <lb/>
(not easily wandering on winding paths, <lb/>
but worthy of their Master's name in Art)<lb/>
will swiftly trace straight on their panels <lb/>
what was already painted in their Imagination<lb/>
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Drawing directly on the panel is the work of a Master.</ab>

5. and falling on it straightaway, without great effort,<lb/>
with brush and paint, and a courageous heart. <lb/>
And thus these companions in work, as they paint,<lb/>
swiftly set down their forms in ground color,<lb/>
then sometimes repaint at once<lb/>
for a better composition.  So those who are<lb/>
rich in invention work boldly, <lb/>
here and there correcting their faults.<lb/>
