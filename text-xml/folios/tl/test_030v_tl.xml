through what I have related here,
to help silence those who believe
that the Reflection is forced into a bow
from the hollow clouds.
Because at <i>Tivoli</i>, springing up very high,
there are Various Fountains of surpassing beauty,
and I have also seen Rainbows appear in them.

18. …in the humid air, through which 
the brilliantly shining Sun pierces its rays. 
But from where does the Rainbow summon
its beautiful colors? If those who have
left us their writings on this subject
are not wrong, it receives them itself 
from the clouds, and carries them 
from the Air and fire mingling with them.

19. <i>Ezekiel</i>, a blessed Prophet,
saw the glory of the Lord shining everywhere,
just as the Rainbow, when it has rained,
reveals itself in the clouds to men’s eyes.
One may well think too of John: 
He heard a voice sound like a Trumpet
and saw, in his vision, the Rainbow
enthroned, lovely as an emerald.

20. Beholding the form of the Rainbow,
said Jesus ben Sirach, they will praise Him
whose creature or creation it is,
for it has (said he) a very beautiful pure color,
In the same way, <i>Simon</i>, the High Priest, 
when he brought the veil to decorate the temple, 
compared it to the Rainbow,
with its lovely colored light.

21. Also what the Poets say of <i>Iris</i>,
how her garment has many colors
and brightly lustrous: this is all 
in total what is seen in the Rainbow.
In order to depict it, one should
mark well how the colors stand out,
how finely they flow in drifting away
and seem to grow out of one another.

22. At hand is purple, then incarnadine,
or pale white, to add color well;
then orange, or glorious red, 
then mastic yellow, then delicate green,
then clear azure, like the neck feathers of a Peacock,
and following again, purple. To dominate
with such a variegated cloak is the custom
for this leading messenger of <i>Juno</i>.
