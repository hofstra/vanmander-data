2. And for this reason he was named <lb/>
<i>Anthropographus</i> (that is, painter of Men). <lb/>
For even if one can reasonably <lb/>
depict the parts of the Human body,<lb/>
and all that belongs to it,<lb/>
to be familiar with everything is more praised:<lb/>
so then to be an exceptional<lb/>
painter, one must be skilled in all things.<lb/>
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>That one should seek to be universal.</ab>

3. We may begin our education at once,<lb/>
by turning to tame Beasts.<lb/>
First, the noblest of the Cattle, of great worth,<lb/>
Then to the helpful courageous Horses,<lb/>
Noble (I say), because there are many qualities<lb/>
to be found in Horses, they are like Dogs,<lb/>
Being true to their Master and loving him.<lb/>
Their free, high disposition cannot be overcome.<lb/>

4.  The Horse scorns fear, indeed, he goes to meet<lb/>
the armored company, bold, unthinking,<lb/>
not fleeing the sword, pawing the ground;<lb/>
like the Hart, he senses the battle, <lb/>
hearing the sound of the clear trumpet, <lb/>
gentle play entertains him, he is docile yet powerful,<lb/>
and fleet as the Wind (as Poets say).<lb/>
He learns to honor his Master and bow before him.<lb/>

5.  <i>Caesar</i> <i>Dictator’s</i> Horse <lb/>
let no one ride him except his Lord, <lb/>
King <i>Nicomedes’</i> Horse in ancient times<lb/>
died of starvation on the death of his Lord;<lb/>
Another, having committed the abomination of incest<lb/>
with his mother, was so sorrowful that,<lb/>
once the blindfold was removed from his eyes<lb/>
leaped to his death from a mountain.<lb/>

6. Shall I tell of the Horse of the Scythian King <lb/>
who killed his Lord’s murderer?<lb/>
Or the Horse of <i>Centaretus</i>, who threw himself<lb/>
off a rock with <i>Antiochus</i> on his back, in revenge,<lb/>
to make him pay for the death of his master–<lb/>
shall I be silent? And of <i>Bucephalus</i>,<lb/>
who did such wondrous things, one and another,<lb/>
that <i>Alexander</i> named his tomb and a City for him?<lb/>

7. Indeed, I will pass over all of this, <lb/>
so as not to waver from my intention.<lb/>
Indeed, more fitting here is the book <lb/>
which <i>Pliny</i> himself devotes to the Tournament of Horses,<lb/> 
where he described everything that cultivates<lb/>
the fine Form of a Horse (as he said).<lb/>
This book seems to be gnawed by the teeth of age,<lb/>
