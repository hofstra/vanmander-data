to sweat while the other (flinging down<lb/>

People took great pleasure marveling at this,<lb/>
For at the time there was no painter<lb/>
Who could depict the passions so unsparingly.<lb/>

34. All the movements of the limbs<lb/>
of nymphs, goddesses and concubines<lb/>
should appear lively and agile,<lb/>
just as Ariosto describes Alcina,<lb/>
who never took a step forward<lb/>

with a graceful and charming allure.<lb/>

35. Another of <i>Pictura’s</i> virtues<lb/>
is to mimic the distinctions between ages,<lb/>
particularly to give form to the simplicity of young people<lb/>
to show their inclination to pleasure,<lb/>
lively and innocent in all they do.<lb/>
Also women, unaccustomed to labor:<lb/>
Her poses are not praiseworthy<lb/>

36.  Now, to give our ladies modesty,<lb/>
 we must cross Pliny’s threshold,<lb/>
and meet a very old example<lb/>
from an ancient ruined temple,<lb/>
where one can still see, painted with <lb/>
incomparable beauty, <i>Helen</i> and <i>Atalanta</i>; <lb/>
in <i>Atalanta</i>, with a shy, embarrassed and<lb/>
chaste manner, is revealed the form of a maiden. <lb/>

37. <i>Zeuxis</i>, a painter very circumspect in his art:<lb/>
his <i>Penelope</i> also serves as a lesson for us,<lb/>
for in this figure he diligently gathered<lb/>
together all the gestures of nobility and modesty<lb/>
which are befitting in a Princess.<lb/>
Likewise <i>Castiglione</i> does not permit his noble Lady<lb/>
heavy masculine activities,<lb/>
only feminine ones, of a gentle sort.<lb/>

38. Let us depict our maidens and ladies<lb/>
with a modest manner, to sustain decorum; <lb/>
though <i>Zeuxis</i> (as we read), elsewhere in this work,<lb/>
had too much confidence in <i>Homer</i>, <lb/>
so that he let figures of women exhibit<lb/>
heavy harsh and rough activities,<lb/>
which should instead suit mature<lb/>
young men, or <i>Amazons</i>.<lb/>
