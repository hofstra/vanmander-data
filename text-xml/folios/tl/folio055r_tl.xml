30. Green signifies Spring in the four seasons,<lb/>
Red is Summer, because the Sun glares with heat;<lb/>
Blue is Autumn, with its grapes nearby;<lb/>
Black is Winter, gloomy, without cheer.<lb/>
Thus the Colors signify many meanings.<lb/>
On this, having washed my stained hands,<lb/>
I will now stop speaking,<lb/>
In order to guide Youth to the Lives of the Painters.<lb/>

other subjects or gone on longer.<lb/>
But Architecture, with its related matters<lb/>
such as proportion and foreshortening,<lb/>
are already clearly brought to light, printed in our language.<lb/>
Further, my own affairs and household business<lb/>

otherwise I would have presented a thousand things.<lb/>

32. So, O Young painters, take pleasure in much<lb/>
and let it serve you for the best.<lb/>
Beginning in difficulty, do not scorn<lb/>
the path of Virtue, for see, it leads to joy,<lb/>
through sweet enjoyment of prosperity at the end.<lb/>
Thus you should find examples<lb/>
in the Lives and Works of the Painters, <lb/>
and in reading (so I think), you will at once learn to paint.<lb/>
