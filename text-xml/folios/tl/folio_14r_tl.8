28. Where one shoulder carries the weight, <lb/>
the leg on the same side cannot fiddle with its position<lb/>
but must stay rigid under the burden.<lb/>
Further, also see to it that the figure<lb/>
does not stride beyond what is natural and graceful;<lb/>
that is, when feet are placed more than a footâ€™s length apart.<lb/>
Keep in mind that the Ancients paid attention to standing<lb/>
as well as to taking a step and walking. <lb/>

swerving outward only a little or hardly at all,<lb/>
they present to all Art-lovers<lb/>
a pleasant movement, indicating action,<lb/>

30. Like the exuberant nymphs, female figures<lb/>
dancing, some leaping from the ground<lb/>
with both legs, others on their toes: <lb/>

And if we need an example, <lb/>
<i>Canachus</i>, who was in earlier times valued for his art,<lb/>
(as Pliny reveals to us)<lb/>
a sculptor in stone and bronze.<lb/>

which aroused such wonder,<lb/>
standing so artfully and lightly on its legs,<lb/>
that one could have pulled a thread<lb/>

into a joyous leap, while <lb/>
from the front, it seemed to rest on its heels.<lb/>

32. In moving figures one should precisely<lb/>
pay attention to Nature, so that the limbs are working fully, <lb/>
whether hands or fingers, on the lute or harp,<lb/>
play, shoot, or throw something,<lb/>

All the limbs must move together<lb/>
in a walking figure, and furthermore, <lb/>
all actions depicting movement should be rendered artfully.<lb/>
