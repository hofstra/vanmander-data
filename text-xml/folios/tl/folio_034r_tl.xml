and red Roses, with a lovely fragrance,<lb/>
to which this clear liquid served as a mirror:<lb/>
between high Oaks, where no sun could go;<lb/>
here, hidden in the shadow within,<lb/>
affords space for a cool dwelling<lb/> 
under branches and leaves so dense<lb/>
no sun could penetrate, a gaze even less.<lb/>

an inviting bed, which would delight anyone<lb/>
coming by, tired, hot, or thirsty,<lb/>
tempting them sweetly to rest. <lb/>
Thus painters should never be condemned<lb/>
for learning poetic works,<lb/>
for they can learn and be awakened,<lb/>
by many things that extend to painting.<lb/>

61. At last, O happy disciples of <i>Gyges</i>,<lb/>
whoever wanders in <i>Pictura’s</i> labyrinth,<lb/>
urged to study its paths with diligence,<lb/>
Wherever you wander, aroused to joys,<lb/>
You are commanded to follow Nature’s [string]<lb/>
to keep your Eyes attentively on her School.<lb/>
Never let your work dishearten you.<lb/>
And thus, you will enjoy a happy outcome.<lb/>

1. Young painters, who have been long locked up<lb/>
And cramped with persistent labor in Art,<lb/>
stiff, almost dull, you have worn out<lb/>
your senses in your lust for learning to know more.<lb/>
Hold on! For now, enough pulling<lb/>
the plow, time to unyoke yourself from your work, <lb/>
for even the strong Man needs rest.<lb/>
The bow need not always be bent.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab>
<margin>right-middle</margin>Young painters ought to become accustomed to the Landscape, and sometimes, when there is the opportunity, to leave the city early to look at nature and amuse themselves by drawing something.</ab>

to sprinkle your eyes.<lb/>
Now in the flowering Summer of brief nights,<lb/>
