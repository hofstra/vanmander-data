the beautiful bluish green seen in<lb/>
the valleys of lower Bohemia,<lb/>
where <i>Cynthius</i> with his radiant arrows,<lb/>
even under the sign of Cancer, Leo or Virgo,<lb/>
cannot whiten, wholly or in part,<lb/>
those damp places, nor diminish<lb/>
their beautiful color, green like Medean stone.<lb/>

27. But in the happy season of Spring,<lb/>
one must attend to the decorative, jewel-like<lb/>
colors of stone, and work diligently<lb/>
to create those patterns of <lb/>
Emerald or Sapphire green, like a chessboard.<lb/>
Further, in the center, the sinuous windings<lb/>
of the murmuring streams crystalline as glass,<lb/>
flowing between the grassy green banks<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Streams running through the meadows.</ab>

28. We should plant both sides <lb/>
of these twisting brooks of Fish<lb/>
with delicate sedge, reeds, and sword-like iris,<lb/>
and refresh the still pools<lb/>
that mirror the rough banks,<lb/>
as the gentlest of <i>Eolus’</i> messengers<lb/>
and his lady love frolic happily<lb/>
on the beautiful carpet of the <i>Hinnides</i>.<lb/>

29. Rivers overrunning their banks <lb/>
should be shown wandering in these marshes;<lb/>
take care that the water always moves toward the lowest point.<lb/>
There beneath, to embolden Art,<lb/>
building Sea-towns, stretching to high ground,<lb/>
with Castles on Cliffs, difficult to destroy.<lb/>
And then, climbing somewhat higher, let us nimbly<lb/>
divide the outstretched Field into sections. <lb/>

30. On one side, Ceres with her blond ears,<lb/>
the other, the field still full of unripe oats;<lb/>
there <i>Eurus</i>, to pass the time, comes sliding in,<lb/>
making the field a Sea of green waves<lb/>
with a gentle rustling murmur.<lb/>
Here grows Vetch, there Buckwheat, and clover,<lb/>
Red and blue flowers in the wheat,<lb/>
And useful flax, the color of sky.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Fields with their crops, blown by the wind.</ab>

31. Also, the plowed Fields, crossed with furrows,  <lb/>
or sometimes plains with harvested crops;<lb/>
and again, meadows and Fields with ditches,<lb/>
hedges and wandering paths.<lb/>
Then some peculiar cluster<lb/>
of Shepherds’ huts or Farmers’ cottages<lb/>
in rocky caves, hollow trees,<lb/>
or with walls and roofs raised on stilts.<lb/>

</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Occasionally, plowed Fields, and paths, though one must be able to see where the paths begin and end.</ab>
