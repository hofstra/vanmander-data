8. Thus the navel naturally appears to be <lb/>
the middle point of this human body, <lb/>
and just as this exquisite round form is perceived in it, <lb/>
so you can equally find a true square.<lb/>
Measure amply from the crown to the soles of the feet,<lb/>
And then once between the fingertips<lb/>
when the arms are outstretched,<lb/>
And it will produce the same measure.<sup><comment>6 Or frames with threads stretched cross-wise,

9. <i>Vitruvius</i> has written this before me,<lb/>

10. But I have not pursued such vexations as<lb/>
matters of minutes, or the divisions of thumbs,<lb/>
to keep the young Painter from going so far astray.<lb/>
The customs of Great Masters or Sculptors<lb/>
are unsuitable trails for Youth;<lb/>
I have often heard Painters say<lb/>
that those who measure too much stick fast to measuring<lb/>
and achieve nothing exceptional.<lb/>
</ab>
<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>According to the measurements of Geometers, minutes or grains are a quarter of the width of a finger; four fingers make three thumbs. Five minutes equals one ounce; one degree is two feet.  Too many measurements are not, or at least only a little, useful for Painters, since painting well is their goal; however, measuring is necessary for Sculptors</ab>

11. Vitruvius, one of the wisest Giants<lb/>
in the Builders’ Art, always shows a way<lb/>
without the danger of getting lost.<lb/>
Observe: the Young must be commanded<lb/>
to measure using heads, feet and noses:<lb/>
from the Person’s head to the soles of the feet<lb/>
is eight heads; each head is four noses.<lb/>
I find this a quick and convenient way to measure.<lb/>

12. In order to measure eight heads <lb/>
correctly and without any difficulty, you will try<lb/>
to place your figure on a vertical line.<lb/>
The head, from crown to chin, shall be counted as one;<lb/>
From the chin to the middle between the nipples is also one eighth;<lb/>
From there to the navel and further to the genitals<lb/>
Makes four. The remaining four should be<lb/>
The mid-thigh, the knee, mid-shin, and the sole of the foot.<lb/>

13. Thus you will also go to work to measure breadth.<lb/>
From right to left, clothed or unclothed,<lb/>
A man’s shoulders are two heads wide, the hips<lb/>
are the width of two faces. Now for the female body:<lb/>
The height is the same, but the width of the hips <lb/>
is exactly twice that of the head;<lb/>
while the width of the shoulders<lb/>

<margin>right-middle</margin>A woman and a man have the same proportions; but in a man’s, the shoulder is a nose-length wider; and in a woman’s, the hip is likewise.</ab>
