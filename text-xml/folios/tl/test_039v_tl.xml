14. It is true, chestnut is nothing to scorn,<lb/>
one can put them in the work where one pleases,<lb/>
in the foreground, to appear with force,<lb/>
or elsewhere: but I say, to pay attention to<lb/>
the glossiness, or the glistening of the coat, <lb/>
as we see making an appearance in Sunshine;<lb/>
so also in the black. But to receive praise,<lb/>
be mindful of the flickering hair on the flanks.<lb/>

15. Study different breeds, such as Horses of Spain,<lb/>
with their elegant outlines, and then those of Turkey, Barbary<lb/>
and Naples,  or those from the Campagne,<lb/>
and also, how the Chestnut’s coat is sometimes brown<lb/>
and sometimes seemingly streaked with honey. <lb/>
It is difficult to explain<lb/>
how Nature is so inclined here <lb/>
to ply her remarkable variety.<lb/>

16.  Beautiful Dapple-gray color, which may not dissemble,<lb/>
where the hide gleams as if full of scales,<lb/>
is a joy to see. Then Nature will deceive us<lb/>
(so it seems), so that one could believe it is<lb/>
a white coat covered with flies. <lb/>
There is much more in this regard, but we must know<lb/>
to paint the Horses’ mouths and noses  <lb/>
in their proper colors, as well as tails and manes.<lb/>

17. Sometimes the bay has four white feet<lb/>
and a star will adorn its forehead.<lb/>
We should also study the <i>Pose</i>,<lb/>
as in human figures;  they walk, stand,<lb/>
jump, and turn with pure balanced grace.<lb/>
Study too the white foam, with which<lb/>
They sow the field, and already showing<lb/>
signs of running as if in flight. <lb/>

18. Once, as <i>Valerius</i> <i>Maxiumus</i> has written,<lb/>
a famous Painter  who had made a Horse,<lb/>
a Horse,  wondrously fine, from exhausting work.<lb/>
And when he wished, among other things, <lb/>
to affirm his Art, making that foam <lb/>
that came floating from the mouth,<lb/>
this artful laborer devoted long <lb/>
and fruitless time and effort on it.<lb/>

such small, insignificant and unworthy things,<lb/>
he was seized with regret. <lb/>
