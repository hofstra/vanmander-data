at children and flowers. <i>Asclepiodorus</i>, good at measure, or 
proportion. <i>Amphyon</i>, good at composition. <i>Serapio</i>, skilled in large works, and <i>Pyreicus</i>, 
in small; <i>Anthiphilus</i>,in large and small. <i>Dionisius</i> could paint only Human figures.  
<i>Euphranor</i> could paint all subjects. <i>Nicias</i>, animals, especially Dogs. <i>Nicophanes</i> was 
skilled at copying and clean in his work. <i>Mechopanes</i> made his colors too harsh. <i>Nealces</i> 
was skilled at depiction. <i>Aristides</i>, at emotions. <i>Clesides</i>, at working from life as well as from 
memory; and <i>Ludius</i>, at Landscape.  <lb/>

We would find the same differences among today’s Italians and 
Netherlanders–too long to discuss here–by which Youth shall learn to 
persevere in Art, and to seize upon that which Nature offers him most. Failing 
to achieve perfection in the painting of figures and histories, one could paint 
Animals, Kitchen scenes, Fruits, Flowers, Landscapes, Architecture, 
Perspectives, Cartouches, Grotesques, Night scenes, Fires, Portraits from life, 
Seascapes, and Ships, or still more subjects.<lb/>

But above all, everyone must ardently and passionately strive to grasp 
the supreme mastery of our art, which can be achieved without danger, 
without war or bloodshed, only on condition of coming to the aid of generous 
Nature, earnestly and with constant diligence. I want to encourage our dear 
Young Painters with a warm, joyful and stimulating exhortation, and to advise 
them at the same time never to become distant or depart from virtue, honor, 
kindness and civility, which must be companions of the constant, faithful and 
intimate Arts, for all noble and fine spirits. Farewell.<lb/>
