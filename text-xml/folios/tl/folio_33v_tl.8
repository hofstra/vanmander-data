also gold or silver plates and vases, <lb/>
transparent ice, and glasses filled with wine,<lb/>
which create spots on the tablecloth with their reflection.<lb/>
Painters should pay attention to all this.<lb/>

53. On many other objects one clearly sees<lb/>
gleams, glossiness, reflected light, and mirroring,<lb/>
there one can learn a particular lesson<lb/>
about Nature, the Mistress of Painting,<lb/>
with steadfast attention:<lb/>
how gleaming Fish, and tin and brass objects,<lb/>
reflect off one another;<lb/>
for example, in paintings by Lange Pier.<lb/>

54. This man arranged colors wonderfully <lb/>
considering these matters:<lb/>
the appearance of all life, the green with the ripe;<lb/>
one could seem to grasp with one’s hand<lb/>
some plates sitting the dark,<lb/>
winking with such a gleam<lb/>
that one would behold with the ardor<lb/>
suitable to an Amsterdam Art-lover.<lb/>

55. In sum, in Art he was transcendent<lb/>
at bring Reflection beautifully to life,<lb/>
indeed, an agile and clever betrayer<lb/>
of Men’s eyes, and a brilliant liar.<lb/>
For one seems to see all manner of things<lb/>
Though it is but colors, which he knew how to mix<lb/>
So that a plane seems round and the flat seems raised,<lb/>
the mute can speak and the dead live.<lb/>

56. There is in my memory a History<lb/>
in the Loggia of Raphael, in which<lb/>
Isaac makes love to his Wife<lb/>
while the Sun shines into the room.<lb/>
The artful burin of the praised <i>Dürer</i> <lb/>
also presented the Sun’s reflection<lb/>
in his <i>Jerome</i> in his Study,<lb/>
which was never done better or with greater skill.<lb/>

57. Of reflection and penetrating rays,<lb/>
which are more than one could dream of,<lb/>
we will finish; and relate<lb/>
how one sees down in still water <lb/>
without ripples, perfectly reversed,<lb/>
Greenery, irises, Mountains, Houses, and trees,<lb/>
and drinking Cattle, Sheep, Cows, Horses<lb/>
or whatever birds are there.<lb/>

58. We find a cleverly [painted]wild beautiful place <lb/>
artfully described by the second <i>Maro</i>,<lb/>
where <i>Angelica</i> flees from <i>Renaud</i><lb/>
