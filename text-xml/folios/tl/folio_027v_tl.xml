56. One <i>Aristonidas</i> strove with his senses<lb/>
to depict well in a bronze Figure <lb/>
(an unusual thing!) the emotion of wrath, <lb/>
of the angry and stubborn<lb/>
<i>Athamas</i>, King of <i>Thebes</i>, <lb/>
who had his own Son <i>Learchus</i> <lb/>
thrown to his death from a high crag.<lb/>
[The artist] depicted him in a seated pose.<lb/>

57. Nevertheless in such a form as if to behold<lb/>
that he was coming to his senses,<lb/>
and repented, with grieving sorrow,<lb/>
such a murderous act devised by him.<lb/>
So, he mixed his bronze with iron, <lb/>
with foresight, to give this face<lb/>
a blushing redness, bewildered and wild, <lb/>
as the iron became rusty.<lb/>

58. This Figure was still displayed in the Greek<lb/>
city of Thebes in <i>Plinyâ€™s</i> time, <lb/>
when the rusty Iron, mingled<lb/>
with the gleaming Bronze, revealed<lb/>
the flush of confusion in that face.<lb/>
Now then, O Painters, hearing the greatness<lb/>
of sincerity and effort in these matters,<lb/>
Let your sleeping spirit awaken.<lb/>

59.  You can more aptly and easily <lb/>
achieve your goal, straight and without error,<lb/>
painting and repainting with all your colors<lb/>
so that your Figures almost utter from their mouths<lb/>
all the emotions hidden in their hearts.<lb/>
In a wrathful head you can paint two burning coals<lb/> 
sheltering under two dark brows,<lb/>
that bulge high over smoldering thunder.<lb/>

60. Just as <i>Michelangelo</i>, following <i>Dante</i>,<lb/>
painted the Captain of the ship of hell<lb/>
in his Last Judgment, one should place<lb/>
the iris of the eye surrounded by white edges,<lb/>
above as below, through both exposures.<lb/>
the surface of the Face should be greatly bloated,<lb/>
red and fiery from raging heat;<lb/>
the brow should be furrowed like the head of a Lion.<lb/>

61. Gaunt Envy, full of jealousy,<lb/>
cadaverous and wan, savage, bitter, <lb/>
artfully described by <i>Ovid</i>,<lb/>
banished to her cold, dark, foul dwelling.<lb/>
We leave her with her vicious food<lb/>
