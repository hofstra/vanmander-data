<ab>51. You can certainly criticize a fellow student, <lb/>	
but I must always insist on civility:<lb/>
it will taste better to him if he is hungry. <lb/>
But do not be a flatterer or hypocrite,<lb/>
Singing sweet <i>Placebo</i> to his face<lb/>
While forcing your and then behind his back<lb/>
force your throat into ugly cadences and wrong notes: <lb/>
that is, praising in his presence and insulting in his absence.<lb/>

<ab>52. Turn away from the spirit of arrogance,<lb/>
which could easily blind you to contentment<lb/>
and swell the pride in your heart, <lb/>
so that from now on, satisfied with learning, <lb/>
you will rest without plowing ahead:<lb/>
because he who adds contentment <lb/>
to his possession, is wonderfully happy: <lb/>
and he who is content (they say) is rich.<lb/>

</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>One should avoid arrogance.</ab>

<ab>53. Yet in our profession one must be careful<lb/>
if one wants to excel in Arts,<lb/>
and always strive to go farther. <lb/>
Do not blithely despise someone’s work,<lb/>
For often nothing is so bad<lb/>
that one cannot find in it something <lb/>
with a quality worthy of praise. As regards the rest:<lb/>
what shall we say? Each does his best.<lb/>
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Nothing so bad that there is not sometimes good in it.</ab>

<ab>54.  Further, one should neither praise nor scorn <lb/>
oneself nor one’s own handiwork,<lb/>
since praise will bring your foolishness to light<lb/>
and scorn smacks of ambition;<lb/>
so these paths both lead to shame.<lb/>
Let good, knowledgeable people judge, <lb/>
because to praise oneself is folly,<lb/>
and to despise oneself is ridiculous<lb/>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>One must neither praise nor despise oneself.</ab>

<ab>55.  Many who are apt to stand at the market <lb/>
hawking one or another quack remedy <lb/>
are accustomed to boasting this way,<lb/>
praising themselves and their blather<lb/>
and despising others among their Peers. <lb/>
But all who shelter in the tents of <i>Helicon</i><lb/>
must avoid this, take heed, and resolve<lb/>
not to suffer the punishment of the <i>Pierides</i>.<lb/>

must take care not to go to his ruin<lb/>
with taunts and Magpie’s chatter<lb/>
like the boasting <i>Satyr</i> who was flayed;<lb/>
