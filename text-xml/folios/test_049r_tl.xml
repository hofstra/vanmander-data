For flesh color composed of lake and white<lb/>
Cannot create a lifelike complexion;<lb/>
rather, vermilion glows more like flesh.<lb/>

30. To create the effect of a glow, consider carefully,<lb/>
and make the dark areas agree well <lb/>
everywhere with the demands of the complexion,<lb/>
which has comeliness in its diversity: <lb/>
in Children, maidens, and Blooming youths,<lb/>
in different Ages, and People<lb/>
who roast every day in the Sun’s heat–<lb/>
attend well, and you will not go wrong.<lb/>
</ab>

31.  For Farmers, Herders and those who sail
through furious waves, battered by storms,<lb/>
one should not spare yellow ocher<lb/>
in the vermilion, for their bare limbs<lb/>
appear almost half roasted;<lb/>
while in such places where one sees uncovered <lb/>
those protected daily from the heat, <lb/>
the skin moves more toward white.<lb/>

32. While placing shadows, you must work wisely<lb/>
so as not to depart from the natural in any way.<lb/>
Seek also to please the everyday eye.<lb/>
On occasion, invent reflecting lights;<lb/>
make your shadows appear fleshly<lb/>
and your highlights, just like skin.<lb/>
Do not highlight nudes with white, whether Man or Woman,<lb/>
For in life, one does not see pure white.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>The everyday eye also desires to be satisfied. </ab>

33. Because many painters spatter their nudes<lb/>
with white highlights, and are so wrong,<lb/>
so that they would no longer do so,<lb/>
there were some Writers who wished<lb/>
that Lead-white were as expensive<lb/>
as beautiful precious stones one seeks<lb/>
in far countries, in costly mines,<lb/>
or as pure Ultramarine.<lb/>
</ab>

<margin>right-middle</margin>To avoid white highlights, one wished lead-white to be as expensive as Ultramarine</ab>

34. Now, to help understand the sense of highlights,<lb/>
I will tell what Goltzius said,<lb/>
that Titian (it is worth hearing) <lb/>
had painted in a Nativity<lb/>
a shepherd seen from the front, coming forward;<lb/>
on his forehead, to make it stand out well,<lb/>
there appeared only a single highlight<lb/>
while the rest dissolved and vanished.<lb/>

35. So the Italians are more inventive<lb/>
in their use of color than we are. Whatever we do,<lb/>
their figures are much plumper and softer<lb/>
than ours; we also have the habit of enhancing light<lb/>
