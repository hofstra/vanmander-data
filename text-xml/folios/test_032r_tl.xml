35. Likewise, to depict <i>Vulcan</i>, <i>Cyclops</i>,<lb/>
with their bare limbs, who made<lb/>
the mountain <i>Gibelli</i> tremble with their blows,<lb/>
forging there the thunderbolt of <i>Jupiter</i>,<lb/>

37. When the light is in its proper place, take care<lb/>
where the reflection should overwhelm the shadow.<lb/>
But speaking of lights and night,<lb/>

passing through a window is considered with intelligence<lb/>
since it gives these lights a natural appearance.<lb/>
