forms, qualities, being, and inclinations; <lb/>

some should sit, lie, crawl,<lb/>

sometimes a few figures either fall down,<lb/>  
if appropriate, or stealthily creep,<lb/>  
some look upwards, lean, or crouch;<lb/>

23. Many Composers also consider something<lb/>  
which I will not avoid and will stress,<lb/>  
to wit: that they should surround the true and<lb/>  
entire main point in their histories,<lb/>  
inscribed in a circle<lb/>  
so that a portion of the figures <lb/>  
surround the narrative, which as the center point <lb/>  
remains standing in the middle, such as a figure<lb/>  
which many behold or worship. <sup><comment>1 My example: Spranger, Adoraiton of the Kings. Mediema’s example: Sprnager, Martyrdom of St. John the evangelist, since VM praised it in his Lives. (London, NG)[note; Miedema 472.] Another good example (mine): Polidoro da Caravaggio, Christ Carrying the Cross, c. 1530.

24. But a composition can hardly be beautified,<lb/>  
according to my sense and my thinking,<lb/>  
by allowing only half the bodies of people,<lb/>  
horses, cattle, calves or other figures, <lb/>  
to appear in the frame, unless there is<lb/>  
a ground element that comes forward, made of stone<lb/>  
or something else, which suggests that<lb/>  
it is this which obscures the rest from view.<lb/>

I write this with good intention, and not to scorn the great Masters who have not perceived this.

an abundance of buildings,<lb/>
