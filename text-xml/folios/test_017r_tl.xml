her figures must be diverse<lb/>  
in poses, shapes, actions,<lb/>  
forms, qualities, being, and inclinations; <lb/>  
and as we said of the seven directions,<lb/>  
some figures should stand or stride facing us<lb/>

others, with face and body in profile.<lb/>

22. Some seen from behind should show their heels,<lb/>  
some should sit, lie, crawl,<lb/>  
or climb, sink down, stand upright, kneel,<lb/>  
sometimes a few figures either fall down,<lb/>  
if appropriate, or stealthily creep,<lb/>  
some look upwards, lean, or crouch;<lb/>  
it is important to create a mixture<lb/>  
of clothed, half-clothed, and naked.<lb/>

23. Many Composers also consider something<lb/>  
which I will not avoid and will stress,<lb/>  
to wit: that they should surround the true and<lb/>  
entire main point in their histories,<lb/>  
inscribed in a circle<lb/>  
so that a portion of the figures <lb/>  
surround the narrative, which as the center point <lb/>  
remains standing in the middle, such as a figure<lb/>  
which many behold or worship. <lb/>

according to my sense and my thinking,<lb/>  
by allowing only half the bodies of people,<lb/>  
horses, cattle, calves or other figures, <lb/>  
to appear in the frame, unless there is<lb/>  
a ground element that comes forward, made of stone<lb/>  
or something else, which suggests that<lb/>  
it is this which obscures the rest from view.<lb/>

an abundance of buildings,<lb/>  <lb/>  
of horses, dogs, or other tame animals<lb/>  <lb/>  
or beasts, and birds of the forest;<lb/>  <lb/>  
but especially enjoyable to the eye are<lb/>  <lb/>

and also decoration, and ornaments,<lb/>  
various attractive fantasies <lb/>  
in abundance (Copia), making beautiful harmony<lb/>  
of excellence in Picturaâ€™s tents, <lb/>
