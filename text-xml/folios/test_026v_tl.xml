44. Now to make a sad face, full of pathos<lb/>
and inner feeling but without <lb/>
the shedding of tears, as is sometimes the case, <lb/>
one should slightly raise the eyebrow on the left side,<lb/>

draw and shorten the crease running <lb/>
from the nose to the cheek; <lb/>
thus should one depict a melancholy being.<lb/>

46. The hands on the heart, lying crosswise,<lb/>

the hands clasped together with fingers interlaced,<lb/>
and contrary to this, like East and West,<lb/>
the despondent face should look up toward the other side.<lb/>
