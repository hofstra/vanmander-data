who were diligent in painting and sculpture,<lb/>
<i>Pausias</i> can serve as an example. <lb/>
He was the first, a long time ago, <lb/>
to paint the Offering before the Altar;<lb/>
oxen ready for sacrifice appeared foreshortened.<lb/>
In this he knew how to pour out all his art. <lb/>

38. Where others placed them sideways <lb/>
and with highlights, he placed his easily<lb/>
with the heads forward, and never or rarely<lb/>
highlighted, but blended with deep shadow;<lb/>
the volumes and foreshortening,<lb/>
a joy to behold, he achieved without great effort<lb/>
and better than the rest. Thus, in earlier times,<lb/>
<i>Nicias</i> of Athens excelled<lb/>

39. at painting Animals, especially<lb/>
Dogs, and with great skill made <i>Diana</i>,<lb/>
As well as <i>Callisto</i> transformed into a Bear,<lb/>
and <i>Io</i> into a Cow: but I need not <lb/>
discuss all his other works here, <lb/>
it is enough for me to affirm<lb/>
that he painted four-footed Animals<lb/>
of all kinds wonderfully well.<lb/>

40. Now we wish to tell further<lb/>
of two brothers in art, from <i>Rhodes</i>,<lb/>
Apollonius and <i>Tauriseus</i>, carvers<lb/>
of Figures, whose leaping Bull is not lost,<lb/>
but can be seen by everyone in <i>Rome</i>.<lb/>
There is <i>Dirce</i>.> (whom the Gods later<lb/>
transformed into a fountain, as the poets told),<lb/>
also <i>Zetus</i> and <i>Amphion</i>, fine nudes.<lb/>

41.  These Figures, the Bull, and even the cords<lb/>
which bound <i>Dirce</i> in her shame,<lb/>
were artfully wrought: sculpted not piece<lb/>
by piece but, with great intelligence, <lb/>
from a single block of white Marble.<lb/>
It was brought by Ship over the Sea,<lb/>
barren and sandy from <i>Rhodes</i> to <i>Rome</i>, <lb/>
where it stands, still admired, in a wooden house.<lb/>

42. O Myron, how could I banish<lb/>
to dark obscurity your cast bronze Heifer?<lb/>
About which Greek Poets praise you <lb/>
with many Epigrams, because above all, <lb/>
she was so artfully made as to seem alive?<lb/>
The first of an entire dozen reads thus:<lb/>
“Herders, drive all your cows elsewhere,<lb/>
lest this one go to the stable with yours.”<lb/>
