All of which things should be required<lb/>
For portraying gloomy winter days;<lb/>
As sometimes our sight cannot discern<lb/>
towers and houses, in Cities and Villages,<lb/>
any further than one could throw a stone.<lb/>

15. Some people accuse us<lb/>
of never painting fine weather,<lb/>
but the Sky is always changeable and full of clouds,<lb/>
grudging <i>Apollo</i> almost a tiny hollow<lb/>
through which he can cast his gaze downward<lb/>
toward his Mother, which dissatisfies him,<lb/>
and the flowers who love him<lb/>
turn in vain to receive his beautiful gaze.<lb/>

16. To avert all this unpleasantness,<lb/>
let us now clear the Sky of clouds,<lb/>
and at times display it entirely pure<lb/>
in the clearest azure or smalt,<lb/>
though with clean tools, to stay spotless:<lb/>
and the lower down the lighter it is, gently dissipating<lb/>
so that next to the heaviness of the Earthly Element<lb/>
it will always be, as is fitting, the brightest of all.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Making entirely pure blue Skies, growing brighter lower down.</ab>

17. When we wish to display the full Sun,<lb/>
we should crown it with a light lake, <lb/>
somewhat purplish, blending it throughout.<lb/>
Yet all the same, such brilliant substance <lb/>
will always elude us, beyond our powers.<lb/>
While our Art is noble, so vast, so splendid,<lb/>
here we must rightly reproach our own work,<lb/>
since our Torches will never glow as brightly.<lb/>

18. Unless we knew how to commit <lb/>
(as the Poets say) a celestial theft<lb/>
in the quadriga of Prometheus.<lb/>
But fearing punishment, and to please ourselves,<lb/>
let us descend to the earthly plane,<lb/>
proceeding at once to the planes of the Landscape <lb/>
which one works, on canvas or panel,<lb/>
to divide into or three or four.<lb/>

19. First of all, our foreground should appear<lb/>
properly solid, set off from the rest.<lb/>
Bring forward something large,<lb/>
like Bruegel, and other such famous names<lb/>
to whom we offer the palm in Landscape.<lb/>
For in the work of these worthy Persons<lb/>
There are many mighty tree trunks in front;<lb/>
Let us eagerly imitate them. <lb/>
