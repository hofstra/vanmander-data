Mijn schrijven eenich voordeel doen ghewinnen,
Soo wijs' ick u te volghen de patroonen,
Die welck <i>Eupompus Lisippum</i> ginck toonen.

1. Speaking of reflection or luster,<lb/>
we must begin with the radiance of the Sun.<lb/>
for one sees its light, stand out above all;<lb/>
all stars would lack clarity<lb/>
without the reflection of the sun,<lb/>
which bestows on the sky its beautiful aspect.<lb/> 
It is the Worldâ€™s Soul in the midst of the Planets; <lb/>
we should not forget it in our purposes.<lb/>

2. When night, with its black sails of dark omens,<lb/>
needs to retreat from the field,<lb/>
and unveils once again beautiful things <lb/>
in all places on the Face of the earth, <lb/>
then one can see in the shadowy clouds<lb/>
a Radiance, or luster,<lb/>
as the Sun comes to bring joy with the day<lb/>
and spreads the Light with many colors.<lb/>

3. It is a delight for heart and mind <lb/>
in the dawn, before one sees appearing<lb/>
the principal light of the Earth with golden rays,<lb/>
to see the azure fields of the Orient<lb/>
sown with red Roses and purple Flowers;<lb/>
How can one find a more beautiful Reflection,<lb/>
which many Poets in earlier times<lb/>
have described with painterly art?<lb/>
</ab>

4. Of <i>Aurora</i> (as the Poet says)<lb/>
Cephalus told stories to <i>Phocus</i>,<lb/>
How she was seated on Mount <i>Hymettus</i>,<lb/>
Which is perpetually in bloom;<lb/>
Her mouth was red beyond Coral,<lb/>
and that in rising and setting, she always<lb/>
honors the morning and evening,<lb/>
bestowing on them the first and last light.<lb/>
