39. In the composition one should not tangle<lb/> 
or allow [figures] to intertwine one with another,<lb/> 
arms and legs, seeming to fight/do battle,<lb/> 
but rather simply, evenly, straight<lb/> 
things should follow one another:<lb/> 
I have also heard much praise, as/when<lb/> 
The figures in a History mostly appear<lb/> 
completely uninterrupted and in their entirety. <lb/> 
</ab>
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>On not entangling too much in the History, so that one thing does not obscure another; and on seeking to make most of the figures as whole as possible.</ab>

40. To harmonize with the nature of Art,<lb/> 
making figures or faces, as is the case,<lb/> 
we should make is so that one is seen<lb/> 
behind the other, indeed, even if it is<lb/> 
not necessary for anything to be there;<lb/> 
for this will make (as in a dark stable)<lb/> 
the shadowed figure appear to recede, <lb/> 
and our foreground figure will seem to emerge.<lb/> 
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Also to display the figures behind the principal figures: how they stand or sit on the ground, and behind the foreground face make another one, which is darker, to bring it out.</ab>

<ab>
41. And further, we especially ought to make sure<lb/> 
in the History, as we have revealed elsewhere,<lb/> 
that when bringing many shadows together in a heap,<lb/> 
not to let strong darks be placed too abruptly<lb/> 
and forcefully against bright lights, <lb/> 
but rather against half-tones; then in the center<lb/> 
we should build up an even, strong light,<lb/> 
which, along with darks, will dissolve into half-tones.<lb/> 
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Make in the foreground or middle ground an even brightness/light, which at either side fades from half-tone to dark.</ab>

42. In former times there long reigned a confusion<lb/> 
among Painters, foolish-minded,<lb/> 
that their Histories at a distance<lb/> 
were thought to be marble, or chessboards,<lb/> 
applying black on white, as printers printed;<lb/> 
but then came from Italy Mezzotints<lb/> 
in beautiful half-colored tones, <lb/> 
which dissolve behind everything like a mist.<lb/> 
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Things showing light strongly against dark, similar to a chessboard.</ab>

43. It surely behooves us not to overlook but<lb/> 
diligently “<b>plumb the depths</b>”<lb/> 
to depict fully the meaning of the History,<lb/> 
while nonetheless luxuriating in our freedom,<lb/> 
not like <i>Andromeda</i> chained to the rock:<lb/> 
for the Painters, according to the testimony of Horace,<lb/> 
in all they are or are known to be,<lb/> 
have similar power to Poets.<lb/> 
</ab>	

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Similarity between a painting and a flowery field, where the eyes are like bees, happy among a variety of different artful blossoms.</ab>

<ab>
44. We see that our ancestors, when they (namely?)<lb/> 
wanted to execute a devout History,<lb/> 
skillfully placed the most important figures<lb/> 
prominently in the front (as is well fitting)<lb/> 
very striking, easy to distinguish,<lb/> 
</ab>	

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>In a devout History, making figures prominent.</ab>
