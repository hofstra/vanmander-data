in the sun and the moon, also painted by <i>Rosso</i>, <lb/> 
<i>Phoebus</i> and <i>Diana</i> were flying up in the sky<lb/> 
as two naked figures, although such things<lb/> 
are not executed solely to amplify<lb/> 
but might be understood as<lb/> 
personifications: poetic devices<lb/> 
which metaphorically indicate a meaning.<lb/>

69. <i>Nealces</i>, one of the renowned ancients,<lb/> 
was artfully experienced at Invention,<lb/> 
as he revealed with his brush<lb/> 
when he painted a battle at sea, <lb/> 
in which the Persians were fighting against <lb/> 
the Egyptians on the River Nile.<lb/> 
Yet he was troubled and perplexed for a while<lb/> 
about how to depict the waters of the Nile. <lb/> 
</ab>

70. To him it was impossible <lb/> 
to distinguish the Nile from seawater,<lb/> 
so he painted a Crocodile<lb/> 
which, secretly and in silence, seemed to lie in wait <lb/> 
for an ass, which had come to the water’s edge<lb/> 
and stuck his muzzle in the river, <lb/> 
his head submerged<lb/> 
as if he were drinking from it.<lb/>

71. He did this so that anyone <lb/> 
would easily acknowledge<lb/> 
that this Battle took place on the river Nile, <lb/> 
for this is the food and the place <lb/> 
which Crocodiles especially like.<lb/> 
Such natural indications,<lb/> 
like Persons and Cities, as well as Rivers,<lb/> 
beautifully enrich our works.<lb/>

<margin>right-middle</margin>Note here a fine conceit copied from the life of Timanthes: to make observers believe that Venus, if seen from the front, would be the fairest; just as Agamemnon, with head covered, would be deemed the saddest.

72. Be it Water, Sea, Lake, or Spring,<lb/> 
they have all in earlier times by the Ancients<lb/> 
been dedicated to some pure Divinity,<lb/> 
and the particular depictions <lb/> 
remaining here generally resemble one another,<lb/> 
appearing in human form:<lb/> 
one of these depictions, for example,<lb/> 
is the Nile in white marble stone.<lb/>

or Egyptian hands, there is no mistaking<lb/> 
its beautiful antiquity,<lb/> 
in the courtyard of the Papal Vatican in Rome,<lb/> 
lying under the blue Sky,<lb/> 
and so artfully is the reclining Nile<lb/> 
depicted–yea, in Essence and action–<lb/> 
that it is marvelous and worthy to behold.<lb/>
