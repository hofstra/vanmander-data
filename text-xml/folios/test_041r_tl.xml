should hang down and reach to the shins.<lb/>
<i>Maro</i> said this when advising the Farmers,<lb/>
but just as I have said before, <lb/>
Cows and Heifers should not be carelessly <lb/>
painted as frightening as Bulls and Oxen.<lb/>

32. For very often, or commonly, <lb/>
the Female kind among all Animals is <lb/>
far smoother, glossier, softer <lb/>
and handsomer; one should note this<lb/>
as well in People, Cats or Dogs.<lb/>
The horns of Bulls or Oxen should be ringed<lb/>
with shaggy hair twisting in curls<lb/>
from the forehead down to the nose.<lb/>

33. You should avoid displaying Cows and Heifers <lb/>
as too rough and shaggy;<lb/>
their limbs should be gracefully modeled.<lb/>
Sometimes certain Heifers <lb/>
Among others (you will notice)<lb/>
are those who have been fattened in their stalls,<lb/>
so beautifully muscled with plump flanks <lb/>
that you would rejoice to look at them<lb/>

34. because of the great beauty of their appearance.<lb/>
From this and other things in life in general<lb/>
you may seek and practice.<lb/>
Yet you must also consider the colors<lb/>
of Oxen and Cows: red, gray and pale,<lb/>
how wonderfully mottled they all are,<lb/>
and that the ears are always the same,<lb/>
not one a hair different from the other.<lb/>

35. Take note of this when you see cows <lb/>
in the green meadow know it to be true.<lb/>
Yet above all I discourage recklessly<lb/>
making their heads so shoddily long <lb/>
as some do when working from life.<lb/>
If you wish to improve your faculties for good painting,<lb/>
paint Animals from life, and straightaway<lb/>
they will enjoy a proper appearance.<lb/>

<i>Bassano</i>, rich in art, who alone is supreme<lb/>
in painting Beasts, and whom no one<lb/>
can better in distinction, <lb/>
painted his curly Sheep, and shaggy Goats,<lb/>
his Birds, Fish, Fruits, and materials,<lb/>
from life, for here is where we must arrive.<lb/>
