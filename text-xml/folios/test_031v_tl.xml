29. In <i>Orlando</i> <i>Furioso</i>, the <i>Ferrarese</i> Poet<lb/>
of fine style tell his story in such a manner<lb/>
that they seem to be painted,<lb/>
enchanting his Reader as sweetly as<lb/>
he describes <i>Ruggiero</i> [enchanted] by <i>Alcina</i>,<lb/>
when, after a festive party,<lb/>
she grandly led him into a bedchamber<lb/>
to enjoy unfettered freedom with him.<lb/>

30. The Pages proceeded with much Torchlight <lb/>
to drive away the darkness;<lb/>
accompanied with cheerful Personages,<lb/>
<i>Ruggiero</i> went to find the soft featherbed<lb/>
spread out there for his pleasure,<lb/>
and sheets [perfumed] with rose-water,<lb/>
of such fine white linen<lb/>
that <i>Arachne</i> herself might have woven.<lb/>

31. The raging flame from a fire (a terror<lb/>
in Men’s hearts) when it flares up,<lb/>
produces a fervid glitter with its sparks,<lb/>
the heavier and thicker the dark sail of night,<lb/>
the  brighter are its powerful flames,<lb/>
further, they cast a tinted glow<lb/>
on Houses, Temples, or other buildings,<lb/>
and even in the water create a frightening view.<lb/>

32.  Those who depict with their colors<lb/>
raging <i>Vulcan</i>, such a horrific misery,<lb/>
are rulers in the realm of Art.<lb/>
For according to the diet or the material<lb/>
which he feeds his impetuous flames,<lb/>
difficult to tame, flying up to the sky,<lb/>
they also take on colors:<lb/>
red, purple, blue, or a shade of green.<lb/>
</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>That Art is painting fire well.</ab>
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>That flames have an appearance based on the material that feeds it</ab>

33. Not only flames, but also smoke<lb/>
fills the sky with various colors;<lb/>
indeed, they resemble the dreadful vapors<lb/>
of the <i>Styx</i>, with many hideous phantoms,<lb/>
<i>Hydra</i>, and <i>Cerberus</i>, ranting and roaring:<lb/>
Thus Painters should pay attention here,<lb/>
to represent a fire in a terrifying way,<lb/>
or to stoke the flames of the Poets’ Hell.<lb/>
</ab>

<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>That not only flames but also smoke are of different colors.</ab>

34. Candlelight, not so common a thing,<lb/>
is difficult to depict with art.<lb/>
The best effect is to pose, in the foreground,<lb/>
a figure in shadow from head to toe,<lb/>
and let the light scarcely touch<lb/>
the outline of the nude body, the hair or the clothing.<lb/>
The light must be the center or the starting point<lb/>
